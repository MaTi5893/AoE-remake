EVTDESC173601;The Janissaries have started to protest against reforms imposed by our recently hired advisors from Prussia. If we don't do something about them, they may very well completely prevent us from making any progress towards modernizing our army!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173602;The Janissaries have come before you, my sultan, demanding higher pay for war, arguing that it will motivate the troops, and that only an army with high moral can truly secure our victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173603;Our soldiers looted, terrorized, and vandalized Vienna for three days, during which many Austrian and German works were either stolen or destroyed. The famous statues from the Founder's Vault were sent back to adorn the façade of Sultan's palace, where they remain. As well as being stolen, works of immeasurable artistic value were destroyed merely for their material value. One of the most precious works to suffer such a fate was Peterskirche. Like so many other priceless artworks made of bronze, the statue was melted down for its content by our soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC173605;The Turks are asking us to sent a delegation of military advisors, so they can modernize their military. They offer generous payment in return for our help, and sure enough, such an act will show the world how great and respected our military staff is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156900;Since the formation of Ducal Prussia, many of our nobles are afraid of their potential betrayal, just like during the Swedish deluge. They have suggested making ducal Prussia an integral part of the Polish crown, what should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156901;Our recent changes in taxation policies have made our nobles furious, a few days ago on the meeting of sejm, they have decided to protest against it! Arguing that under their status as "nobility", are entitled to lower taxes, they forget, however, just how dire the situation of our country is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156902;The recent change in the balance of our estates has made our nobility very unhappy, using our militant population they managed to veto our policies to limit their influence in our kingdom. They have successfully restored all their previous privileges!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156903;Today on meeting of sejm our nobility voted to cut our country's taxes in favor of extracting their own payment from their subjects  to support the war effort as well as repurposing some part of your personal treasury to fund necessary equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC156904;The general sejm is the bicameral parliament of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was established by the Union of Lublin in 1569 from the merger of the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Seimas of The Grand Duchies of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia. It is one of the primary elements of the democratic governance in the Commonwealth . The sejm is a powerful political institution and the king could not pass laws without the approval of that body. This however has lead to our downfall, we cannot properly function as a nation anymore, no effective policies can be carried out because of our incompetent nobility! There is only one solution to this problem - a forceful abolishment of our parliament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mug_desc;With the support of the Islamic orthodoxy, a younger son of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707), seized the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and had him imprisoned. During Aurangzeb's reign, the empire gained political strength once more and became the world's most powerful economy. Aurangzeb fully established Sharia by compiling the Fatwa Alamgiri. He expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia, but at his death in 1707, "many parts of the empire were in open revolt". Aurangzeb is considered India's most controversial king with some historians arguing his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society, while other historians question this, noting that he built Hindu temples, employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims, and married Hindu Rajput princess Nawab Bai. Without him we cannot effectively govern our empire anymore without resorting to granting more autonomy to different states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But who will lead us? who can provide all these things? Now that we're independent this question has been on everyone's mind. There are two viable options: A republic with a "president" as the head of state or a constitutional monarchy with a king at its lead;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC177503;By the beginning of 1770, there were 4,000 British soldiers in Boston, a city with 15,000 inhabitants, and tensions were running high. On the evening of March 5th, crowds of day laborers, apprentices, and merchant sailors began to pelt British soldiers with snowballs and rocks. A shot rang out, and then several soldiers fired their weapons. When it was over, five civilians lay dead or dying, including Crispus Attucks, an African American merchant sailor who had escaped from slavery more than twenty years earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC177504;The recent Tea act has sparked an immense number of protests all across the colonies. A group called "Sons of Liberty" has proposed a cunning plan to take revenge on the British for such stupid policies. They propose to disguise themselves as natives, and throw the nearest shipment of tea from The East India Company into the ocean. All they demand from us it to not condemn the actions after the event. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC177505;On Tuesday last the body of the people of this and all the adjacent towns, and others from the distance of twenty miles, assembled at the old south meeting-house, to inquire the reason of the delay in sending the ship Dartmouth, with the East-India Tea back to London and having found that the owner had not taken the necessary steps for that purpose, they enjoined him at his peril to demand of the collector of the customs a clearance for the ship, and appointed a committee of ten to see it performed, after which they adjourned to the Thursday following ten o’clock. They then met and being informed by Mr. Rotch, that a clearance was refused him, they encouraged him immediately to enter a protest and apply to the governor for a pass port by the castle, and adjourned again till three o’clock for the same day. At which time they again met and after waiting till near sunset Mr. Rotch came in and informed them that he had accordingly entered his protest and waited on the governor for a pass, but his excellency told him he could not consistent with his duty grant it until his vessel was qualified. The people finding all their efforts to preserve the property of the East India company and return it safely to London, frustrated by the tea consignees, the collector of the customs and the governor of the province, DISSOLVED their meeting.--- But, BEHOLD what followed! A number of brave and resolute men, determined to do all in their power to save their country from the ruin which their enemies had plotted, in less than four hours, emptied every chest of tea on board the three ships commanded by captains Hall, Bruce, and Coffin, amounting to 342 chests, into the sea!! without the least damage done to the ships or any other property. The masters and owners are well pleased that their ships are thus cleared, and the people are almost universally congratulating each other on this happy event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1754001;A prominent officer has been rising trough the ranks of our military, displays of great caution and strategic mind are all valuable to an effective military commander. A proposition have been made to grant this young lad the rank of general and have him among our greatest officers so we can strengthen our military force.x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17860001;For a few weeks now our parliament has been fiercely debating over the question of our capital. Many proposition have been made, including New York, Charleston and Philadelphia. Choosing any of these cities will result in either southern or northern contempt, since it seem as if the federal government is favoring either southern or northern states. There has also been talk of building a new capital city, one set in a natural territory symbolizing a balance between all the states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC180500001;Louisiana is a territory which doesn't necessarily serve much purpose to us. Currently it is used to sustain our colony in Haiti. An idea has sprung among our government officials to sell it to the United States for a great price, so we can afford to fund our future wars. this would surely bring the significant boost to our economy we seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC180500002;Our French brethren have proposed a deal to us. For a small price of 2,000,000 dollars we may acquire their colony of Louisiana. This is an incredible opportunity for our young nation, we may finally make a significant expansion to the west, without losing a single life. We should consider this offer, though very tempting, the price is incredibly high and may put us in debt, the ultimate decision will be made by you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC180500003;The United states have agreed to our proposal and have sent us the appropriate sum of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT177501DESC;In spite of the recent losses in our last war, the parliament has made decision to enact a new tariff on our American colonies, so we may safely recover from our economic downfall. Imposed a direct tax on the British colonies in America the "Stamp Act" requires many printed materials in the colonies to be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies, and it had to be paid in British currency, not in colonial paper money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT177502DESC;In spite of the recent losses in our last war, the parliament has made decision to enact a new tariff on our American colonies, so we may safely recover from our economic downfall. The principal objective was to reduce the massive amount of tea held by the financially troubled British East India Company in its London warehouses and to help the financially struggling company survive. A related objective was to undercut the price of illegal tea, smuggled into Britain's North American colonies. This was supposed to convince the colonists to purchase Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament's right of taxation. Smuggled tea was a large issue for Britain and the East India company, since approximately 86% of all the tea in America at the time was smuggled Dutch tea. The Act granted the Company the right to directly ship its tea to North America and the right to the duty-free export of tea from Britain, although the tax imposed by the Townshend Acts and collected in the colonies remained in force. It received the royal assent on May 10, 1773.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC170000;Peter's visits to the West impressed upon him the notion that European customs were in several respects superior to Russian traditions. He commanded all of his courtiers and officials to wear European clothing and cut off their long beards, causing his Boyard, who were very fond of their beards, great upset. Peter also sought to end arranged marriages, which were the norm among the Russian nobility, because he thought such a practice was barbaric and led to domestic violence, since the partners usually resented each other.In 1699 Peter changed the date of the celebration of the new year from 1 September to 1 January. Traditionally, the years were reckoned from the purported creation of the World, but after Peter's reforms, they were to be counted from the birth of Christ. Thus, in the year 7207 of the old Russian calendar, Peter proclaimed that the Julian Calendar was in effect and the year was 1700.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700001;In the winter of 1723, Peter, whose overall health was never robust, began having problems with his urinary tract and bladder. In the summer of 1724 a team of doctors performed surgery releasing upwards of four pounds of blocked urine. Peter remained bedridden until late autumn. In the first week of October, restless and certain he was cured, Peter began a lengthy inspection tour of various projects. According to legend, in November, at Lakhta along the Finnish Gulf to inspect some ironworks, Peter saw a group of soldiers drowning near shore and, wading out into near-waist deep water, came to their rescue. This icy water rescue is said to have exacerbated Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Staehlin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely that no one else would have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link. In early January 1725, Peter was struck once again with uremia. Legend has it that before lapsing into unconsciousness Peter asked for a paper and pen and scrawled an unfinished note that read: "Leave all to ..." and then, exhausted by the effort, asked for his daughter Anna to be summoned. Peter died between four and five in the morning 8 February 1725.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700002;Peter III was Emperor of Russia for six months in 1762. He was born in Kiel as Charles Peter Ulrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, the only child of Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and Anna Petrovna.The German-born Peter could hardly speak Russian and pursued a strongly pro-Prussian policy, which made him an unpopular leader. He was deposed by troops loyal to his wife, Catherine, despite her own German origins, was a Russian nationalist. She succeeded him as Empress Catherine II. Peter died in captivity soon after his overthrow, perhaps with Catherine's approval as part of the coup conspiracy.Despite his generally poor reputation, Peter made some progressive reforms during his short reign. He proclaimed religious freedom and encouraged education, sought to modernize the Russian army, abolished the secret police, which had been infamous for its extreme violence, and made it illegal for landowners to kill their serfs without going to court. Catherine reversed some of his reforms and carried through others, notably the annexation of church property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700003;Though Catherine's life and reign included remarkable personal successes, they ended in two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolph, visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement was supposed to be announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured to accept that Alexandra would not convert to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. The frustration affected Catherine's health. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony which would establish her favourite grandson Alexander as her heir, superseding her difficult son Paul, but she died before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball. On 16 November 1796, Catherine rose early in the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon settling down to work on papers; she told her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, that she had slept better than she had in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 she was found on the floor with her face purplish, her pulse weak, and her breathing shallow and laboured. The court physician diagnosed a stroke and despite attempts to revive her she fell into a coma. She was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700004;News have been recently brought to the palace of your majesty about the possibility of a coup being organized by the king's wife, Catherine. They say that for a few weeks now she's been securing trust and legitimacy in various ways. News comes now that she has even managed to secure the backing of the orthodox church. Your Majesty, what shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700005;In July 1762, barely six months after becoming emperor, Peter lingered with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to Oranienbaum, while his wife was at a different palace nearby. On the night of 8 July (OS: 27 June 1762), Catherine the Great was given the news that one of her co-conspirators had been arrested by her estranged husband and that all they had been planning must take place at once. The next day, she left the palace and departed for the Ismailovsky regiment, where she delivered a speech asking the soldiers to protect her from her husband. Catherine then left with the regiment to go to the Semenovsky Barracks, where the clergy was waiting to ordain her as the sole occupant of the Russian throne. She had her husband arrested, and forced to sign a document of abdication, leaving no one to dispute her accession to the throne. On 17 July 1762—eight days after the coup that amazed the outside world and just six months after his accession to the throne—Peter III died at Ropsha, at the hands of Alexei Orlov (younger brother to Grigory Orlov, then a court favourite and a participant in the coup).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1788000;The leaders of the Anjala conspiracy met in Liikkala to secretly open communications with Tsarina Catherine the Great. Major Johan Anders Jägerhorn delivered the Liikkala note dated August 8, 1788 to the empress. The letter note was signed by several officers, including Armfelt, Commander-in-Chief of the Savo forces and the king's closest confidant. The officers declared the war to be illegal, asked for the restoration of the Finnish borders according to the Treaty of Nystad of 1721, and for peace negotiations with representatives of the Finnish nation, which they understood as representatives for the eastern and northern half of Sweden, which during the 18th century had twice been harshly occupied by Russia, and whose population overwhelmingly were ethnic Finns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1788001;The leaders of the so-called Anjala conspiracy have declared your majesty's rule incompetent and they have seceded our country with the help of Russia. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC172100;The king is dead, whilst the nation reels in grief, a new episode in Swedish history is mounting. The Riksdag of the Estates is gaining massive influence, with its powers restored by order of the new queen, Her Majesty Queen Ulrika. What developments Sweden will experience under this new political atmosphere remains a mystery. If it will usher in an era of untold prosperity in representation of the common people, or if the aristocracy will turn the kingdom into a puppet to line their pockets with, is yet to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721001;For decades the two factions have torn Sweden apart. The Age of “Liberty” has turned the Kingdom into a sordid melting pot of corruption and covetousness. After great, save futile, attempts from His Majesty Gustav III to dispel the political animosity of the court, he has come to the conclusion that to save Sweden from inevitable Russo-Prussian invasion, he has no other choice than to launch a revolution. On the 19th of august he finally paraded his officers through the palace, soon before declaring the new constitution he addressed them: “If you follow me, just like your ancestors followed Gustav Vasa and Gustavus Adolphus, then I will risk my life and blood for you and the salvation of the fatherland!";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721002;To dare any possible assassins, the King went out into an open box facing the opera stage. And after roughly ten minutes he said “this would have been an opportunity to shoot. Come, let us go down. The ball seems to be merry and bright.” The King with Baron Hans Henrik von Essen by his right arm went around the theatre once and then into the foyer where they met Captain Carl Fredrik Pollet. The King, von Essen and Pollet continued through a corridor leading from the foyer towards the opera stage where the dancing took place. On the stage several masked men - some witnesses talked of 20 or 30 men - made it impossible for the king to proceed. Due to the crowd, Pollet receded behind the King, who bent backwards to talk to Pollet. Anckarström stood at the entrance to the corridor holding a knife in his left hand and carrying one pistol in his left inner pocket and another pistol in his right back pocket. Anckarström edged himself behind the King, took out the pistol from his left inner pocket and pulled the trigger. Because of the King turning backwards the shot went in at an angle from the third lumbar vertebrae towards the hip region. The King twitched and said “ai” without falling. Anckarström then lost courage, dropped the pistol and knife and shouted fire. People from the King’s lifeguard stood some meters away. When they reached the King, they heard him say “ai, je suis blesse”. (I am wounded.) The king was carried back to his quarters, and the exits of the Opera were sealed. Anckarström was arrested the following morning and immediately confessed to the murder, although he denied a conspiracy until informed that Horn and Ribbing had also been arrested and had confessed in full. The king had not been shot dead; he was alive and continued to function as head of state. The coup was a failure in the short run. However, the wound became infected, and on 29 March, the king finally died with these last words: "I feel sleepy, a few moments' rest would do me good";;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME91241542;Mazepa rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91241542;As the Swedish and Polish armies advanced towards the Ukraine, Mazepa allied with them on 28 October 1708. However, only 3,000 Cossacks followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar. Mazepa's call to arms was further weakened by the Orthodox Clergy's allegiance to the Tsar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT91241542OPT1;So he is a traitor? After all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC91241543;Those Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected a new Hetman, Ivan Skoropadsky, on 11 November 1708. The fear of further reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa's newfound Swedish ally prevented most of Ukraine's population from siding with him. Surprisingly, the only significant support that he gathered came from the Zaporizhian Sich, which, though at odds with the Hetman in the past, considered him and the nobility he represented a lesser evil compared with the Tsar. The Sich Cossacks paid dearly for their support of Mazepa, as Peter The Great ordered the Sich to be razed in 1709 and a decree was issued to execute any active Zaporizhian Cossack;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC170771;Word comes from Bengal that the traitorous Subahdar Murshid Quli Khan has seceded from the empire and declared himself as the Nawab of Bengal from his capital at Murshidabad. Quli Khan, a Hindu by birth, already had many disagreements with the Alamgir's own grandson over governance of Bengal. Now after Aurangzeb's death the traitor has taken the opportunity to openly declare his act of treason. It appears that he is well supported by local moneylenders and by a strong army. It would thus require a long and costly war to bring him to justice or we could simple accept the grim reality that has haunted the empire since Aurangzeb's death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170772;In a shocking murder of the virtues of loyalty and nobility, Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung, the governor of Karnatak has seceded from the Mughal empire and declared his own state in the Deccan. Zulfiqar Khan had once been the most dependable of generals in Emperor Aurgangzeb's decades spanning campaign in the Deccan. The emperor had showered him with titles like Amir-ul-Umara(Noble of nobles) and eventually made him the Subahdar. Now after the Alamgir's death he appears to have forgotten all this past and has committed this heinous act of treason. With the unstable situation in the north it would be wise to maintain peace with him or we could go to war to stamp out his rebellion. A campaign to put down his rebellion would be very difficult as we would be fighting his armies in the Deccan, his home ground. The decision must be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170773;Taking advantage of the chaos at Delhi after Emperor Aurangzeb's death, the Sikh clans of Punjab have rebelled. The Sikhs have faced religious persecution and political oppression for the last two centuries. A constant guerrilla war has ensued with their Gurus(Religious teachers) in the Punjab and it only intensified after Emperor Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns as the focus of the empire shifted away from Punjab. Now the Sikhs have captured all major forts and towns in the area and declared an independent Sikh state. This threatens to cut off contact between our possessions in Afghanistan with the rest of the empire. We could negotiate with the Sikhs or march our mighty armies to crush their insurrection. Both methods would require immediate action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170774;The flag of rebellion has been raised in Ayodhya as the Subahdar of Ouduh has seceded from the Mughal empire. Ouduh had been one of the richest provinces of the empire since its earliest days. Now the rebellious ruler has kicked out the local Mughal garrison, brought the support of various treasonous chiefs and crowned himself as it's ruler. Additionally, important roads leading from Delhi to Bengal are now in danger of being closed off which could bring trade to a complete standstill. Quick steps should be taken whether we decide to ignore his rebellion in favour of more important theatres or march upon his lands to restore the authority of the Mughal throne on Ouduh once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170776;Grim news comes from Sindh. The Kalhoras have disregarded Mughal authority and declared independence. Sindh is an important center of maritime trade on the Arabian sea and Muslim pilgrims to Haj are an important source of commerce in the region. Kalhora rule of Sindh began in 1701 when Mian Yar Muhammad Kalhoro was invested with title of Khuda Yar Khan and was made governor of Upper Sindh sarkar by royal decree of the Mughals. Later, he was made governor of Siwi through imperial decree. Thenceforth, Mian Yar Muhammad became the imperial governor of the entire Sindh. Now however with the weakening of Mughal authority after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, the Kalhoras have become confident enough to declare open rebellion. We must make moves to crush their confidence by facing them in battle on the lands of West India and crush their rebellion. Alternatively we may just let go of the Subah and concentrate on other theatres. The choice must be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170775;If there is a contender for the second most powerful man in India at this moment, then it's undoubtedly the Nizam of Hyderabad. Unfortunately it appears that this strongman of the Deccan has gotten tired of bowing before Imperial authority. The Nizam of Hyderabad has declared his independence and now claims his rule over most of the Deccan. Our choices are simple. We could match our armies South, fight a tedious war and attempt to crush his rebellion or we could instead avoid bloodshed and come to terms with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170778;The recent spate of wars and civil wars have utterly destroyed the power of the Mughal empire in Hindustan. The green banner of the Mughals, once flying high all over the subcontinent now flutters lifelessly in Delhi and a few remaining areas around it. The empire is now a snakehole of court politics and dirty plots supported by foreign kings. It's gone. But out of the ashes of one empire, a second shall rise! Perhaps it's now our age of glory and by Shiva's grace, we Marathas shall claim it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170777;The flowers have blossomed and the sun shines golden upon Hindavi Swarajya as Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj has returned from his imprisonment in Delhi to lead an independent Maratha nation. After Maharaj Sambhaji's capture and execution by the Mughals, his son Shahu had been imprisoned along with his mother at Delhi by Emperor Aurangzeb. Meanwhile Shahu's uncle and then his cousin had declared themselves as the ruler at Kolhapur while the Mughals swiftly defeated the Marathas and forced them to negotiate. His aunt Tarabai in particular had gone so far as to make peace with the Mughals to ensure the rule of her son Shivaji II. Now with Aurangzeb's death, influential Mughal courtiers have released Chhatrapati Shahu in hopes that he would be a useful ally. Having defeated Tarabai, the Chhatrapati now leads a powerful force of Marathas. With the Mughal collapse, the gates of India are now open for us. Perhaps the rich neighbouring state of Gujurath might be an opportunity for quick conquest if we are ready to face the Mughals as our men have done countless times before that is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC170779;It's our own incompetence and poor luck that has destroyed our once great Mughal empire after the Alamgir's death. Perhaps our warriors didn't fight hard, perhaps out men were not loyal or perhaps Allah is testing us. Whatever may be the reason, it's clear that while we remain the 'Mughal Empire', we are no longer a real empire. Our authority once extending across the entire subcontinent is now only effective in Delhi and the surrounding areas. All over Hindustan, new princes and states have risen and are calling our empire as their own, perhaps rightly so. Even the great Babur had lost Samarkhand and managed to keep his resolve to fight and create the Mughal Empire. Perhaps we may rise again just as he did, but for now we have clearly lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC175001;Oh the Mughal Sooltans were great and big all right, but their era is gone Sir. With their collapse,  India is now open for the Company. Years of investments in schemes and factories on the coast of India have paid off. We have patiently adhered to the rules and regulations of Delhi, we have borne their insults and their conditions and we have tipped our hats in their presence....for a century. No more. Its time we use this opportunity to annex the exclaves of the Mughals. They won't mind of course......because they can't! The East India Company shall now be a force in its own right and soon, the sun shall never set upon the Union Jack. Hail Brittania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1573000;With the recent passing of Augustus II of Saxony, the time has come to honor our country's tradition and gather all the nobility for the election of a new ruler which will lead us to greatness. There have been a few concerns about the involvement of our eastern neighbours in the election, but hopefully it's only rumours. There are 3 main candidates for the Polish-Lithuanian throne: \n- Stanislaw Leszczynski - the current duke of Lorraine and strongly supported by France \n- Friedrich August III of Saxony the son of our previous ruler, who is rumoured to have been getting support from Russia \n- Infante Manuel, the Count of Ourem relatively unknown in our country and among the nobility, however he has a strong support from Austria.\n-The candidates are all fair choices, let's see who receives the most votes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1573001;The recent Election in Poland-Lithuania resulted in the loss of our Candidate! This is an unwelcome surprise, the Russians said our victory will be secured, and the saxon dynasty will continue to rule the lands along the Vistula river! Our only choice is to inform the Russians of this outrageous incident and have them help us secure our rightful throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1573002;A saxon envoy arrived today at our court, telling of the results of Polish-Lithuanian Royal Election, which had our preferred candidate lose! This may effectively destroy all the influence we had in the Polish court, which is unacceptable! We are ought to intervene immediately if we want Poland-Lithuania to never be a threat to Russia ever again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1573004;Sad new have arrived today, as our current ruler has passed away. As tragic as it may be we must keep moving forward and the time has come to once again honor the almost 200-year old tradition of royal election. There have been 3 candidates that emerged as leading figures to secure our throne; \n- Stanislaw August Poniatowski - Supported by Russia, a member of the Czartoryski Family and an intellectual. He is also rumored to had been having an affair with The Russian Tsar - Catharine Romanov. He may be in favor of continuing the Russian schemes in our court. \n- Jan Klemens Branicki is in charge of our southern Ruthenian provinces, he is known to be a conservative and isn't really widely known among the higher Polish nobility. \n- Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, the brother of Stansilaw, the first candidate. A proper member of the Familia party, which has been proposing many liberal reforms for the past years, which all were unfortunately vetoed by our conservative nobility. \n- it is critical we elect a worth candidate, as our very existence as a sovereign nation is at risk in this dark times;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC15730041;Recognizing that the destiny of us all depends solely upon the establishment and perfection of a national constitution, having by long experience learned the inveterate faults of our government, and desiring to take advantage of the season in which Europe finds itself and of this dying moment that has restored us to ourselves, free of the ignominious dictates of foreign coercion, holding dearer than life, than personal happiness the political existence, external independence and internal liberty of the people whose destiny is entrusted to our hands, and desiring to merit the blessing and gratitude of contemporary and future generations, despite obstacles that may cause passions in us, we do for the general welfare, for the establishment of liberty, for the preservation of our country and its borders, with the utmost constancy of spirit ordain this Constitution and declare it to be entirely sacred and inviolable until the people, at the time by law prescribed, by their clear will recognize a need to alter any of its articles. To which Constitution the further statutes of the present Sejm shall apply in everything. Or will it? should we ratify this document my King or is it too dangerous?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC15730042;Not all nobles agree with our newly ratified constitution. A confederation was established by Polish and Lithuanian magnates, in Saint Petersburg, with the backing of the Russian Empress Catherine II. The confederation opposes our new government, which had been adopted by the Great Sejm, especially the provisions limiting the privileges of the nobility. The text of the founding act of the confederation was drafted by the Russian general Vasili Stepanovich Popov, Chief of Staff of Prince Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin. Its purpose was proclaimed in the small town of Targowica and the Potocki's estate (now near Novoarkhanhelsk in Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine).This may result in a full scale Russian intervention...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171107;Louis XIV, known as Louis the Great or the Sun King, was King of France from 14 May 1643. He's best known for introducing complete Absolutism to the Kingdom of France, as well as his conquests in Alsasce and Spanish Netherlands, with the aim to move the border of France all the way to the Rhine. His extravagant life style would also set a precedent for future monarchs, as France during Louis XVI reign would reach it's hight in terms of cultural influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171108;Louis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday, after 72 years on the throne. Enduring much pain in his last days, he finally "yielded up his soul without any effort, like a candle going out", while reciting the psalm Domine, ad adjuvandum me festina (O Lord, make haste to help me).\n\nWhen Louis XIV himself finally died on 1 September 1715, Louis, at the age of five, trembling and crying and against all probability, inherited the throne as Louis XV and until he comes of age, the country will be ruled by a regency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC174500;Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, probably out of mushroom poisoning. He had ignored the advice of Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 gulden, which were claimed by his widow. The army had also been weakened due to these wars; instead of the full number of 160,000, the army had been reduced to about 108,000, and they were scattered in small areas from the Austrian Netherlands to Transylvania, and from Silesia to Tuscany. They were also poorly trained and discipline was lacking. Later Maria Theresa even made a remark: "as for the state in which I found the army, I cannot begin to describe it." But this will all soon come to an end. As Maria Theresa Begins her reign, a new era approaches Austria, one of greatness and prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC174501;It is unlikely that Maria Theresa ever completely recovered from the smallpox attack in 1767, as 18th-century writers asserted. She suffered from shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, distress, necrophobia and insomnia. She later developed edema. Maria Theresa fell ill on 24 November 1780. Her physician Dr. Störk thought her condition serious, although Joseph was confident that she would recover in no time. By 26 November, she asked for the last rites, and on 28 November, the doctor told her that the time had come. On 29 November, she died surrounded by her remaining children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16001;Many have argued that we are not able to achieve victory in our fight for freedom. As difficult as our fight may be, perhaps we should turn to few of our overlord's rivals for help. France is one such nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC6083;The Oirats have decided to focus their efforts west, and as a result we are their new target. Some of our eastern khans have tried to use this time to declare their independence. The Dzungars have seized our eastern territories.  If we accept the Dzungar demands surely we will not be able to keep those territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6082;In 1647 Tibet had a political revolution which gave the Dalai Lama absolute power and diminished Dzungar influence in the country. Having put down the revolt of the Uighurs and taken back our western territories from the khan of Bukhara we can now reassert our dominance over Tibet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6081;Tibet is being invaded by the Dzungars, perhaps soon is a good time for another war with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6080;The Dzungars have done a terrible job managing Tibet and they have attacked one of our garrisons protecting a traditional trade route.It is time to restore order to Tibet and expel the Dzungars from the region.

EVTDESC1721003;As another king drops dead from his throne, the coronation ceremonies are already in full swing. Today we celebrate the ascension of His Imperial Majesty King Gustav, third of his name, dynast of Holstein-Gottorp, first cousin of Catherine the Great, nephew of Fredrick the Great. Truly a man with legitimacy in place of blood in his veins, as is required if one is to rule an empire stretching from Göteborg to Livonia to the top of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC174502;Since the death of Charles II of Spain, the Habsburg family and its realms developed a serious problem. Their male lines began to go extinct. First Charles II died without a heir and that resulted in the war of Spanish succession. In 1703 Charles VI, the prince of Austria signed a mutual pact with his elder brother Joseph I. One of its agreements was that in case they both failed to have a male heir, then Joseph's daughters would inherit all Habsburg pessesions after both of them had died. Joseph became Holy Roman emperor soon after, failed to have a male heir and died in 1711 after which Charles VI succeeded him. However Charles himself failed to produce a male heir and began to worry that upon his death, the Habsburg domains would slip away from his line to Joseph's daughters as decreed by the Mutual pact of 1703. To counter that, Charles has now declared a Pragmatic sanction law according to which his daughters would inherit the throne rather than his nieces. This has not been received well by many in the empire and abroad and may just prove to be the spark of future internal strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6078;The Kazakhs have reclaimed the district of the river Ayaguz. This was possibly a retalitation for our continued raids in their land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC176800;Prince Kristian had always been a strange child, he had no blemish in his brilliant intellect nor his dazzling charisma, but his oddity lay deeper. He was beset by hallucinations, devastating personality swings, melancholy, and an emerging destruction mania. Unfortunately his redeeming qualities could never be fully realized, as his education was largely ignored, and the tutor that he did have was outright abusive. Many speculate that his mental state was inherited through blood, as his Cousin, George III of Great Britain, showed similar traits, known widely as the “Royal Malady”. Upon the death of Fredrik V, Kristian ascended to the throne, his chosen motto was: “Gloria ex amore patriae”, meaning, “glory through love of the fatherland”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171009;It probably started in some backalley in Paris, then it spread to the neighbouring lanes and streets. Further it creeped its way to the surrounding countryside. Now the flame of revolution has spread to the whole of France and threatens to overturn our rule of the Dual monarchy. Years of English rule have been declared as an oppression and French people from every echelon of society have taken up arms against the Dual Monarchy. From lowly peasants to conspiring armymen, many have joined the rebel army and a deadly war to shake the very foundations of our rule in France has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171000;War after war has launched Britain’s debt into orbit. The debt is, in fact, so staggeringly large that nobody actually knows exactly how much we owe. Britain’s balance sheet shows a hastily written rough estimate of “9,000,000 Pounds” (This would only be fully repaid recently, in 2015, three centuries later). Bankruptcy now could very well mean our utter collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171001;Facing up to 20 million pounds of debt, our ministry has been forced to take some desperate measures to keep our nation from outright collapsing. The chancellor of the exchequer (minister of debt) has joined together with a rather.. conniving.. Businessman. Together they have founded The South Sea Company to deal with government debt, a government puppeted trading company with monopoly in Latin America. However, these ports are all owned by Spain, and the recent Spanish war of succession has made British trading here nigh impossible. Instead, to make money, the company has launched a less than honourable scheme, involving all kinds of scamming, corruption, and general skullduggery. The company, without earning a single pound in actual profit, is beginning to make ever accelerating swathes of dishonest money. Money, however, that the government sorely needs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC15730044;Leszczynski's faction has proposed the plan for a reform of the Commonwealth. It involves some radical changes like peasant emancipation, urbanisation, and army reform, as well as stricter organization of political institutions, resulting in stronger central government. Despite that noble privileges are to stay in place, making every "citizen" truly equal to the demise of the most powerful of nobles, and the question lies, indeed, in whether we are willing to challenge omnipotent magnates, and lesser ones loyal to them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC15730043;Folwark system is based on large scale farming and unpaid labour of serfs, arguably a form of slavery. Initially it yielded great profits for economy of the Commonwealth, however it become apparent that in the long run the system was dragging country down, seeing how urbanisation in western Europe, that imported the grain, flourished, while Poland-Lithuania stagnated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1740001;Crown Prince Frederick von Hohenzollern was born to Friedrich-Wilhelm I in Berlin, 1712. Tutored by the same French governess as his father, he was in every aspect pushed to be just like the king. Friedrich-Wilhelm was a man of great renown, popularly known as the “soldier-king”, he had expanded the army by spectacular degrees for his small population, and was generally a very effective ruler. This put massive pressure on Prince Fredrick, who was more interested in art and literature, this would drive his militaristic father to rage, and concluded in beatings and public humiliation. Now he kneels at the foot of the coronation ceremony, standing to inherit an army of 80 thousand of the most disciplined soldiers in Europe. The state of which having observed decades of incline to prosperity, surely Fredrick II can’t possibly muster himself a name so great to rival his father’s?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC176801;King Kristian’s reign was never let go uneventful, it was marked by constant changes in attitude and replacement to the council of advisors depending on his mood. His court life was hectic if not dangerous, he was reported to have been obsessed with destruction, smashing furniture and windows, committing severe self harm, and even beating his own dogs bloody. He was unanimously considered mad by a certain point, for which reason his personal physiatrist, Struensee, gained immense power within the government. In fact, the outright torture Struensee inflicted on Kristian could be the source of his spiralling mental health. His advisors were particularly concerned with the less.. Christian.. Of his hobbies. On the 14th of January 1808 his carrot-waxing was cut short by a stroke, although rumors state that he died due to the shock of observing Spanish auxiliary troops, which he took to be hostile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1740002;Granted, his father had set the kindling, but Frederick II had lit it, the bonfire that is Prussia. Victorious in all the great European wars of his time, he was no mere successor to his father, he had forged a legacy of his own. His military prowess alone, both in theory and practice, has earned him a place among the great of history. But grander still, he had been a patron of art, science, music and culture, truly a bastion of the enlightenment. Infact, upon his accession, he was told by the French philosopher D’Alembert, “The philosophers and the men of letters in every land have looked upon you, Sire, as their leader and model.” The Silesian Wars, The War of Austrian Succession, the Partition of Poland, surely not even death will stop our great Frederick. He will without doubt conquer heaven next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1740005;In his younger years Frederick was sent to a small village in Prussia by his father as a punishment for attempting to flee the country. In that time young Frederick learned the hardships of regular peasants. Through everyday work he realised just how hard was making the prussian soil fertile, and now that he is in charge of our realm, he begun directing more and more royal funds to improve the daily lifes of peasant in his country, knowing that they are one of the most important pillars of this country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1740006;Thausands of Migrants have recently been flooding our borders.

EVTDESC176802;Since the King clearly cannot handle the task layed before him as the ruler of Denmark-Norway we need to appoint a court physician and a perfect candidate has recently distinguished himself. The so called Johann Friedrich Struensee During Struensee's near ten-year residence in Altona he came into contact with a circle of aristocrats who had been sent away from the royal court in Copenhagen. Among them were Enevold Brandt and Count Schack Carl Rantzau, who were supporters of the Enlightenment. Rantzau recommended Struensee to the court as a physician to attend King Christian VII on his forthcoming tour to princely and royal courts in western Germany, the Netherlands, England, and France. Struensee received the appointment in April 1768. Should we Employ me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC176803;Struensee's dismissal of many government officials and officers brought him many political enemies. On 30 November 1771, he declared himself and Brandt Counts. These actions stirred feelings of unease and dissatisfaction in the populace of Denmark and Norway.Now he has been assasinated! Yet the great policies he manege to pass will forever remain intact;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16970;After years of useless bickering and disputes, the matter of the Sino-Korean border is to be decided from the highest pedestals of authority in both nations. The Kangxi Emperor and the Joseon of Korea have both sent their diplomats and agreed to bring an end to this border conflict once and for all. The Qing delegation is led by Mukedeng, and the Joseon delegation is led by Pak Kwon. Befre the meet, the two have held a joint commission to survey and demarcate the boundaries between the two states. After extensive geographic surveys and travels up and down the rivers Yalu and Tyumen, the delegates have finally assembled the information and the meeting has begun. The Koreans claim that the territories held by the 7th century Gorguryeo dynasty north of the river are true and that those boundaries should be restored. However giving in to their demands would be seen as a sign of weakness which might harm us in future diplomacy. Our own claims extend a little south of the river in accordance with the territories claimed by the Jurchen Jaegaseung monks as their homeland. But trying to enforce these claims might antagonize the Koreans and may lead to needless violence. Instead, diplomats from both sides also propose a simple third solution.

EVTDESC174504;The success of the Dutch, British and French East India Companies led the merchants and shipowners of Ostend in the Austrian Netherlands to want to establish direct commercial relations with the Indies. The trade from Ostend to Mocha, India, Bengal and China started in 1715. Some private merchants from Antwerp, Ghent and Ostend were granted charters for the East India trade by the Habsburg government of the Austrian Netherlands, which had recently gained control of the territory from Spain. Between 1715 and 1723, 34 ships sailed from Ostend to China, the Malabar or Coromandel Coasts, Surat, Bengal or Mocha. Those expeditions were financed by different international syndicates composed of Flemish, English, Dutch and French merchants and bankers.Between 1724 and 1732, 21 company vessels were sent out, mainly to Canton in China and to Bengal. Thanks to the rise in tea prices, high profits were made in the China trade. Between 1719 and 1728, the Ostend Company transported 7 million pounds of tea from China (roughly half of the total amount brought to western Europe), which would be about the same as British East India Company during the same period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171002;The South Sea Company was by no means the only company seeking to raise money from investors in 1720. A large number of other joint-stock companies had been created making extravagant (sometimes fraudulent) claims about foreign or other ventures or bizarre schemes. Others represented potentially sound, although novel, schemes, such as for founding insurance companies. These were nicknamed "Bubbles". Some of the companies had no legal basis, while others, such as the Hollow Sword Blade company acting as the South Sea's banker, used existing chartered companies for purposes entirely different from their creation. The York Buildings Company was set up to provide water to London, but was purchased by Case Billingsley who used it to purchase confiscated Jacobite estates in Scotland, which then formed the assets of an insurance company. The passing of the Act gave a boost to the South Sea Company, its shares leaping to L890 in early June. This peak encouraged people to start to sell; to counterbalance this the company's directors ordered their agents to buy, which succeeded in propping the price up at around L750.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171003;In Great Britain, many investors were ruined by the share-price collapse, and as a result, the national economy diminished substantially. The founders of the scheme engaged in insider trading, by using their advance knowledge of the timings of national debt consolidations to make large profits from purchasing debt in advance. Huge bribes were given to politicians to support the Acts of Parliament necessary for the scheme. A parliamentary inquiry was held after the bursting of the bubble to discover its causes. A number of politicians were disgraced, and people found to have profited immorally from the company had personal assets confiscated proportionate to their gains (most had already been rich and remained so).;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, public opinion, as shaped by the many prominent men who lost money, demanded revenge. Walpole supervised the process, which removed all 33 of the company directors and stripped them of, on average, 82% of their wealth. The money went to the victims and the stock of the South Sea Company was divided between the Bank of England and the East India Company. Walpole made sure that King George and his mistresses were protected, and by a margin of three votes he managed to save several key government officials from impeachment. In the process, Walpole won plaudits as the savior of the financial system while establishing himself as the dominant figure in British politics; historians credit him for rescuing the Whig government, and indeed the Hanoverian Dynasty, from total disgrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;

Surely we haven’t declined to the point where we are willing to hand out bloodbound Turkish ground to some covetous snakes. But.. they have gotten quite powerful as of late.

Pirate after pirate hath met their end, be it by sword or pardon, the deaths of greats such as Blackbeard and Black Bart have alerted the world to the fact that Atlantic piracy can no longer thrive as it once did. The great powers of Europe having been at peace for so long has heightened government control over the seas and the use of privateers has declined due to Europe's shift toward free trade. These two factors combined have rendered piracy an unsustainable trade. The merchant can now sleep soundly at night knowing that the Atlantic's air is no longer filled with the fluttering of the jolly roger, nor its waters the sound of the dreadful hull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC175005;Under Mughal rule, Bengal was an affluent province with a major stake in local and foreign trade. It is estimated that during the 16th and 17th centuries, Bengal supplied most of the opium, silk, textiles and saltpetre to local and European markets. In fact, Bengal was so dominant in the trade of Muslim that to this day Muslin is called 'Daka' in central Asia which comes from the Bengali city name of 'Dhaka'! Now all that is gone. With the weakning of the Mughal empire and the resulting civil strife, Bengali trade was shook to its core. Then the incompetent Nawabs and greedy Europeans steadily dismantled Bengal's economy such that now the Europeans control the ports and the trade while Bengal remains as a submissive supplier for Europe's factories. Recently, with an even further decline in the economy and an over-reliance on the Europeans, Bengal has lost the last vestiges of its economic independence effectively making it nothing but a puppet state of the British.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1516002;Grim news arrives from Aragon as popular resentment against heavy taxation combined with the damaging toll of the succession war has resulted in open rebellion against the crown. Despite uniting with Castille to form Spain, Aragon never gave up it's unique culture and administrative practices. Instead, attempts to integrate the region into a Castilian system of governance only resulted in failure and made Aragonese cultural movements stronger. Famine, disease and almost continuous warfare in the Spanish Netherlands drained money, energy and men and weakened the economy so much that it is estimated the population of Spain fell nearly 25% between 1600 and 1700. All this had a damaging effect on Aragon too. Now the economic stress of the succession war and the resulting steep increase in taxation have put the final nail in the coffin and the Aragonese nobility and peasantry alike have taken up arms against the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721005;In the last one and a half century, Sweden has rapidly risen to great power status. With a small yet professional army, the Swedes have built an empire with holdings on both sides of the Baltic by defeated its rivals in Moscow, Poland and Denmark along with numerous other German states.  Since the middle of the previous century, the King Charles XI had ruled Sweden. After the end of the devastating Scanian war in 1679, Charles XI devoted the rest of his life to avoiding further warfare by gaining larger independence in foreign affairs while he also promoted economic stabilization and a reorganization of the military. His remaining 20 years on the throne were thus the longest peacetime that Sweden experienced in recent history. With Charles's death in 1697, the throne passed to his 14 year old son Charles XII. For a few years Sweden experienced an uneasy peace. Now, the treacherous Russians and their allies have decided to take advantage of Charles XII's inexperience and have declared an Anti-Sweden coalition. War has come to Sweden. This war shall decide the fate of Charles XII, the fate of Northern Europe and the fate of Sweden itself.  This war is termed by many as being 'The Great Northern War'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After having gathered near the Moldavian capital Ia?i, the combined Russo-Moldavian army started on 11 July the march southwards along the Prut River with the intention of crossing the Danube and invading the Balkan peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC18999;Napoleon Bonaparte has been rising through the ranks of our military for quite some time, gaining fame and admiration from many French people. Perhaps we should promote hime to a more important rank, so he can truly show how good military leader he actually is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114300;In the early 1700s, Portugal and the english estabilished a commercial and military treaty which some historians claim placed the former as an economic dependency of the latter. From then on the portuguese enjoyed british military support in a number of conflicts, both in Europe and the Americas, thereby serving to maintain unity of their colonial possessions. In return, trade in english textiles and portuguese wine were encouraged by both sides.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114301;The discovery of gold, diamonds and precious stones in the interior of Brazil came with a sudden boom of both the Slave Trade towards the southeast of the colony as well as a large emigration from the kingdom proper towards the colonies. The Crown would try to control this flux, but it was inevitable that lure would be too powerful for the poorer regions in the north to resist.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114302;Dom John V, known as the Magnanimous and the Portuguese Sun King, was a monarch of the House of Braganza who ruled as King of Portugal during the first half of the 18th century. John V's reign saw the rise of Portugal and its monarchy to new levels of prosperity, wealth, and prestige among European courts. Disregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance, John V ruled as an absolute monarch. As a continuation of a Braganza dynasty policy that stressed the importance of relations with Europe, John's reign was marked by numerous interventions into the affairs of other European states, most notably as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. On the imperial front, John V pursued an expansionist policy, with significant territorial gains in Portuguese India and Portuguese America.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114303;John was afflicted with dropsy which caused his death in 1750 at age 60. John is often remembered as one of the greatest patrons of the arts in Portuguese history, having commissioned numerous construction projects and artistic studies. The king's most famous and important work was the Royal Palace-Convent of Mafra.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114304;Sebastiao Jose de Carvalho e Melo, the eventual Marquis of Pombal and Count of Oeira, rose to proeminence as the prime minister of King José I and defacto ruler of Portugal for over twenty years. A controversial figure, sometimes called Portugal's enlightened absolutist, he presided a number of reforms of public administration, education and the very social order of the Kingdom in an effort which, most modern historians agree, were an attempt to concentrate power in the Crown and to revitalize the traditional structures of Portugal.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114305;The first reigning Queen of Portugal would ascend to the throne and immediately seek a policy of reconciliation with those who suffered most the policies of her predecessor. In a process termed 'The Turnabout', the Marquis of Pombal was removed from office, the survivors of the Távora family were pardoned and some of the anti-jesuit policies were rolled back. During her reign, new trade opportunities would be opened with Russia and the portuguese commercial imbalance would be temporarily resolved. However, the Queen suffered from acute melancholy and mental ilness, which eventually rendered her unable to serve during the latter part of her life.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114306;The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, also known as the Great Lisbon earthquake, occurred in Portugal on the morning of Saturday, 1 November, Feast of All Saints, at around 09:40 local time.In combination with subsequent fires and a tsunami, the earthquake almost totally destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas. Seismologists today estimate the Lisbon earthquake had a magnitude of 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicenter in the Atlantic Ocean about 200 km (120 mi) west-southwest of Cape St. Vincent. Chronologically it was the third known large scale earthquake to hit the city (one in 1321 and another in 1531). Estimates place the death toll in Lisbon alone between 10,000 and 30,000 people, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114307;Our capital is being rebuild. The Portugese people from around the country have came to lend their hand in making Lisbon return to at least the fraction of it's past glory.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114308;In an effort to revitalize farming and commerce in northern Brazil, Portugal would be inspired by the french and dutch models in creating monopolist companies with the mandate of maintaining trade routes and expanding the sale of slaves.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC114309;For centuries, the Company of Jesus had been central to the colonization of Brazil in its role of building native settlements and spreading christianity among the tribes.They also became a major pillar of support in Portugal itself, as the ruling house of Braganza faced terrible opposition from a Spain-aligned Papacy since the Restoration War. As such the Order had become the single greatest landowning group across the colonies. Opposition to Jesuit power came in many ways, from landlords who wished to enslave their native charges to, eventually, the economic interests of the State. ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158100;The modern Netherlands Navy dates its founding to a "statute of admiralty" issued by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I on 8 January 1488. Naval historians trace the origins of an independent Dutch navy to the early stages of the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) while the formation of a "national" navy is dated to the establishment of the Dutch Republic in 1597. As an organization, the navy of the Dutch Republic consisted of five separate admiralties (three of them in Holland, and one each in Friesland and Zeeland), each with its own ships, personnel, shipyards, command structures and revenues. It remained as one of the more effective naval institutions in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158101;As War is again upon us, and the enemy is closing in on our capital, perhaps it is time to reestablish the stadtholdress dominating position in our republic. It would allow us to more easly push reforms more easly and gain a greater controll over our government's policys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158103;The unrest in our nation caused by our latest wars and our subsequant achieved by our stadtholder have made our people more open to the idea of a monarch. Now people are ralling in support of our stadtholder, calling for him to take the crown of a new kingdom of the Netherlands. Thanks to the orangist's faction dominance in our politics this might be possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158102;The Patriot movement took in a wide range of supporters: discontented noblemen such as the Gelderland baron Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol wealthy bankers and businessmen without a voice in government; artisans and shopkeepers, traditionally Orangist in sympathy, who were dismayed to find their claims to an effective role in the politics of their towns rebuffed by the princes; and intellectuals committed to the new Enlightenment rejection of arbitrary power. The Patriots included in their ranks many Protestant dissenters and Roman Catholics, but Jews continued to look to the prince of Orange as their protector.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC158104;The looming threat of an invasion has long since passed and the public life has returned to normal. We can lay down our emergancy powers and attend to more pressing internal matters now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1821000;The central American people, unhappy with our rule have seceden from out nation! From the 16th century through 1821, Central America, apart from Panama, formed the Captaincy General of Guatemala within the Spanish Empire. In 1821 a congress of Central American Criollos in Guatemala City composed the Act of Independence of Central America to declare the region's independence from Spain, effective on September 15 of that year. The process was bloodless with no resistance from the Spanish authorities as the Governor General Brigadier Gabino Gaínza, along with all the royal governors of the five provinces, were retained in office as executive powers pending a full transition to local rule. That date is still marked as independence day by most Central American nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1821001;Congress plans to establish a constitutional monarchy united both conservatives and liberals at a time when it was uncertain which form of government would be best for independent Mexico. Congress published an oath binding the emperor to obey the constitution, which Iturbide subsequently took, and Congress also declared the Mexican monarchy to be hereditary, granting titles of nobility to Iturbide's family. His son and heir became Prince Imperial of Mexico. The 19th of May was made a national holiday, and a royal household was organized. July 21, 1822 was set as the date of the official coronation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1821002;As a newly formed and independent nation we should seek living space to expand into. The Spanish have been growing week ever since our secession and their possesions in the carrabbean, perhaps we should lunch a surprise attack to take cube, which could later serve as a perfect lunching point for further conquests in the area?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC170007;Between the years of 1560 and 1658, Sweden created a Baltic empire centred on the Gulf of Finland and comprising the provinces of Karelia, Ingria, Estonia, and Livonia. During the Thirty Years' War Sweden gained tracts in Germany as well, including Western Pomerania, Wismar, the Duchy of Bremen, and Verden. During the same period, Sweden conquered Danish and Norwegian provinces north of the Sound. These victories may be ascribed to a well-trained army, which despite its comparatively small size, was far more professional than most continental armies, and also to a modernization of administration (both civilian and military) in the course of the 17th century, which enabled the monarchy to harness the resources of the country and its empire in an effective way. In the late 1690s, the adventurer Johann Patkul managed to ally Russia with Denmark and Saxony by the secret Treaty of Preobrazhenskoye, and in 1700 the three powers attacked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721006;The bold king of the Swedes has decided to put a Polish noblemen on the throne of the Commonwealth who has promised to act as his ally in the current war. The bulk of the Sejm has been split on the issue.

EVTDESC1740009;In return for an alliance against France in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Great Elector's son, Frederick III, was allowed to elevate Prussia to a kingdom in the Crown Treaty of 16 November 1700. Frederick crowned himself "King in Prussia" as Frederick I on 18 January 1701. Legally, no kingdoms could exist in the Holy Roman Empire except for Bohemia. However, Frederick took the line that since Prussia had never been part of the empire and the Hohenzollerns were fully sovereign over it, he could elevate Prussia to a kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC157303;The Treaty of the Three Black Eagles, or Treaty of Berlin, was a secret treaty signed in September and December 1732 between the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire and Prussia. It concerned the joint policy of the three powers regarding to the succession of the Polish throne in light of the expected death of King Augustus II of Poland (and Elector of Saxony from the House of Wettin) and the Polish custom of royal elections. It intended to exclude the candidacies of Augustus' son, Frederick Augustus, and of Stanislas Leszczynski, who had already been king of Poland from 1704 to 1709. The Treaty of the Three Black Eagles had several goals. The agreement had provisions for all three powers to agree that it was in their best interest that their common neighbour, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not undertake any reforms that might strengthen it and for its elected monarch to be friendly towards them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Pirates come here to stop and repair their vessels, recruit, resupply, spend their plunder or to lie in wait for a merchant ship to pass by. One is hard-pressed to find a thicker froth of wretchedness and bestiality. However, these pirate havens do turn quite a profit, and if kept in check, it may even be in our favour to let them be as perform their trade in wicked peace. However, if we are to take this path, then we will not be able to combat piracy in the future, and our seas will continue to be terrorized by buccaneers;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC15730052;As we enacted the "Vivente Rege" reform, many of our Nobles have lived concerned about the power of the king constantly increasing, and it seems this reform was the last straw. The Law of "Rokosz" is the power to openly amd militarly object the decisions of the king, if a nobleman belives he is acting in bad faith, to end the noble democracy in the Commonwealth.

The Second Continental Congress convened in 1775 in response to the breakout of hostilities in Massachusetts. Soon after meeting, this second Congress sent the Olive Branch Petition to King George III while also selecting George Washington as the head of the new Continental Army. After peace was not forthcoming, the same congress drafted and adopted the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, proclaiming that the former colonies were now independent sovereign states.

EVTDESC176900;Muhammad Ali Pasha al-Mas'ud ibn Agha, known as Muhammad Ali of Egypt and the Sudan was the Albanian Ottoman governor and the de facto ruler of Egypt from 1805 to 1848, is considered the founder of modern Egypt. At the height of his rule, he controlled Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, Sudan and parts of Arabia and the entire Levant. He attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the Mamluks, consolidating his rule and permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC176901;Muhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty. To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military. His first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the iltizam lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the 'tax-farmers' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. Beyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility. A by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a professional bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He was a son of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Emperor Francis I, and the brother of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, Maria Carolina of Austria and Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. Leopold was a moderate proponent of enlightened absolutism. He granted the Academy of Georgofili his protection. Despite his brief reign, he is highly regarded. The historian Paul W.

EVNDESC175507;Charles Emmanuel III was the king of Sardinia–Piedmont and an extremely skilled soldier whose aid other European countries often solicited for the many wars of his time. Having received a military and political education, Charles Emmanuel succeeded his father, Victor Amadeus II, in 1730. During the War of the Polish Succession (1733–38) he joined the side of France and Spain, occupied Milan, and scored a brilliant success at Guastalla (Sept. 19, 1734). By the ensuing Treaty of Vienna he obtained Novara and Tortona (1738). During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48), which engaged the whole European continent, Charles Emmanuel fought against the Spanish, seeing that they, as did he, had designs on Milan. An astute negotiator, he was able to obtain Vigevano in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748).;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC173200;By the late 17th century, the Iranian Safavids, like their arch rival the Ottoman Turks, had been starting to heavily decline due to misrule, sectarian strife, and foreign interests. In 1704, the Safavid Shah Husayn appointed his Georgian subject and king of Kartli George XI (Gurgin Khan), a convert to Islam, as the commander-in-chief of the easternmost provinces of the Safavid Empire, modern-day Afghanistan. His first task was to quell the uprisings in the region. Gurgin began imprisoning and executing Afghans, especially those suspected of organizing rebellions, successfully crushing them. One of those arrested and imprisoned was Mirwais, belonging to the influential Hotak family in the Kandahar region. Mirwais was sent as a prisoner to the Persian court in Isfahan, but Shah Husayn dismissed the charges against him, so he was sent back to his native land as a free man. Protected by the Ghaznavid Nasher Khans, Mirwais and his followers revolted against Safavid rule in Kandahar in April 1709.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171012;I lament to see the honor of the monarchy sunk even to prostitution. For these impertinent words, King James had popular politician John Wilkes arrested and imprisoned. However, this sparked large protests in London, where crowds gathered behind the rallying cry of "For Wilkes and Liberty!" Officials read the Riot Act, instructing troops to fire on the protestors, but this served only to further enflame tensions as the crowd continued to swell. Protests soon rose up across the city and a large mob stormed the Tower of London, freeing all political prisoners. Led by Wilkes himself, the crowd then turned towards Buckingham Palace. The King was captured as he attempted to flee the city and now faces trial for conspiracy against the British people, the verdict a foregone conclusion.\nA Revolutionary Committee led by Wilkes has taken over control of the new republic, promising to abolish serfdom, establish equality under the law and redistribute the nobility's land between the state and the peasantry, leading Great Britain to a future guided by the ideals of liberty and the brotherhood of man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC10001;The Enlightenment emerged out of a European intellectual and scholarly movement known as Renaissance humanism and was also preceded by the Scientific Revolution and the work of Francis Bacon, among others. Some date the beginning of the Enlightenment to Rene Descartes' 1637 philosophy of Cogito, ergo sum (I think, therefore I am"), while others cite the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687) as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. French historians traditionally date its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 until the 1789 outbreak of the French Revolution. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the pursuit of happiness, sovereignty of reason and the evidence of the senses as the primary sources of knowledge and advanced ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government and separation of church and state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Additionally, he claimed he was tortured and threatened with death.

At the same time, Russia was pushing for her own candidate, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, son-in-law of the Czarina Catherine I. After much bribing, negotiation and behind the scene diplomacy, Maurice was summoned to either leave or suffer war.

EVTDESC171130;In 1717 the Mississippi Trade Company was founded. It had a Royal Monopoly on the utilization of the large colonial areas along the Mississippi River in America. In 1719 the Government borrowed 1.5 billion livres from the company. The company was more of a financial institution than a Company of Trade and Industry and the price of shares hit the roof.

The Polish Constitution was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had placed a sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171133;Following the first fall of Napoleon exiled supporters of the monarchy returned to France. They were nonetheless unable to reverse most of the changes made by the French Revolution and the reinstatement of slavery by Napoleon. Exhausted by decades of war, the nation experienced a period of internal and external peace, stable economic prosperity and the preliminaries of industrialization.Unlike the absolutist Ancien Régime, the Restoration Bourbon regime was a constitutional monarchy, with some limits on its power. The new king, Louis XVIII, accepted the vast majority of reforms instituted from 1792 to 1814. Continuity was his basic policy. He did not try to recover land and property taken from the royalist exiles. He continued in peaceful fashion the main objectives of Napoleon's foreign policy, such as the limitation of Austrian influence. He reversed Napoleon regarding Spain and the Ottoman Empire, restoring the friendships that had prevailed until 1792.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1516003;In April 1711 Emperor Joseph II died, and the Emperorship passed down to Charles III. Many great powers fear a return of a untied Habsburg monarchy from the times of Charles V, including France.

EVTDESC173208;Sultan Husayn was the Safavid Shah of Iran from 1694 until he was overthrown in 1722 by rebellious marauder Mahmud Hotaki, an Afghan of Pashtun ethnic background from the Hotak dynasty. His reign saw the downfall of the Safavid dynasty, which had ruled Persia since the beginning of the 16th century. When his father Shah Suleiman was on his deathbed, he asked his court eunuchs to choose between his two sons, saying that if they wanted peace and quiet they should pick the elder, Sultan Husayn, but if they wanted to make the empire more powerful then they should opt for the younger, Abbas. They decided to make Sultan Husayn shah. He had a reputation for being easy-going and had little interest in political affairs, his nickname being Yakhshidir ("Very well!"), the response he was said to give when asked to decide on matters of state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171134;Since the Peace of Ryswick the French liberated the the western half of La Espanola from the terrors of the Spanish barbarians, but only to impose their own evil wishes on the Island that was once known as Hayti or Kiskeya by the Native Taino people where only the elite of whites can enjoy life. Little whites are left uneducated to work minor tasks for their "bigger" overlords, Mulâtres and other Frees of Color are forced to be less then human with no property right or right to legal processes, in spite of this they are the second richest and the most educated group in the colony, but this forgets the vast majority the Black slaves who due to the French barbarians only have life span of 6-8 years.

EVTDESC800009;A confederated realm of German princedoms, along with some adjacent lands, had been in existence for over a thousand years, dating to the Treaty of Verdun in 843. However, there was no German national identity in development as late as 1800, mainly due to the autonomous nature of the princely states, most inhabitants of the Holy Roman Empire, outside of those ruled by the emperor directly, identified themselves mainly with their prince, and not with the Empire as a whole. Now that the Empire has been dissolved, despite the legal, administrative, and political disruption caused by the dissolution, the German-speaking people of the old Empire start to feel they have a common linguistic, cultural and legal tradition. European liberalism is offerring an intellectual basis for unification by challenging dynastic and absolutist models of social and political organization, its German manifestation emphasized the importance of tradition, education, and linguistic unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1581054;Throughout the history of the early Netherlands the state has been run by and for Merchant capitalists. The mayors of the cities, the heads of the East India Company and other state companies have all themselves had a background as merchants and would have had both contact and knowledge of the world of trade that would help them make economically beneficial decisions.This is however increasingly often not the case. The issuing of state bonds to finance government enterprises has served our country well through the years but a side effect has been that there is now a whole generation of rich and influential rentiers who have little to no practical experience of trade. Critics feel that these Wig-wearers lack ambitions beyond achieving cushy government offices and that their carefulness is in fact passivity.

EVTDESC173623;Ali Bey al-Kabir, a Mamluk bey of Georgian origin, has recently come into power in Egypt. Quickly rising through the ranks of Mamluk leadership, he is a cunning and devious leader, exiling or assassinating political rivals and securing control. However, his maneuvering has not gone unnoticed, and a Pasha was sent to replace him. When he tried to assassinate his replacement, his palace was sieged and Kabir was forced into exile. However, instead of exiling to Medina as promised, he remains in exile in Gaza, under the protection of Palestinian strongman Zahir al-Umar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173624;Capitalizing on unrest within the Empire, Ali Bey al-Kabir has returned to Egypt. With his supporters, he has quickly risen in the Mamluk leadership and removed any rivals that threaten his position. Every day, al-Kabir continues to secure his position and gather his Mamluks. Ali Bey al-Kabir is bound to dominate Mamluk rule in Egypt, which leaves the future of Ottoman control of the region uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173625;After Ali Bey al-Kabir's return from exile, his meteoric rise to power within Mamluk leadership has effectively made Egypt's governance answer to Ali, not the Sublime Porte. Ali Bey has only furtherered this point by not only stopping his tribute to the Porte, but minting his own coins. Such a usurpation of the Sultan's privileges is tantamount to a declaration of independence. Ali Bey's armies have quickly secured control of the Hedjaz, and now march together with the armies of the Palestinan strongman Zahir al-Umar into Syria. Our domination of the Levant and Egypt as a whole is being put to question. If we do not respond appropriately, the future of the Ottoman Empire is at risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173626;As ideas of removing Mamluk influence from Egypt becoming floated around more frequently by the Sublime Porte, word has spread from Constantinople to Cairo. The Mamluk nobility have been quick to respond and put aside their squabbling and rivalries, at least for now. Rallying under a prominent Mamluk Bey, Ali Bey al-Kabir, the Mamluks have revolted against Ottoman rule. Ironically, the treason of the Mamluks have given the Sultan the perfect justification to remove them once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173627;Hassan Pasha, a Pasha of Georgian origin, was recently sent to replace the previous governor of Baghdad and revitalize the region. Hassan Pasha has secured power and created a hereditary Mamluk dynasty in Iraq, much to our surprise. His kingdom provides valuable service to the Porte, by way of curtailing Kurdish tribesemen, levying taxes, and protecting against Safavid encroachment. However, a Mamluk kingdom threatens the centralization of the Empire, and may even become powerful enough to claim independence.\n\n§RCrushing the Mamluk Kingdom will speed up acceptance of Mashriqi and put down the revolt§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173628;The Maghrebi War began in 1699 when a coalition of Moroccan, Tunisian, and Tripolitanian armies invaded the Beylik of Algiers and Beylik of Constantine in a vy for dominance over the Maghreb. Although the invading armies greatly outnumbered the Algerians, they have held out and are slowly preparing their counterattack. Our tributaries in Algiers and Constantine have petitioned us for military aid in the form of Janissaries. An intervention in the Maghreb would secure our control over our tributaries, but war with Morocco might dissaude an Empire fresh out of the Great Turkish War.\n\n§RIntervening in the Maghreb War fully and winning against Morocco is necessary if you want to annex and integrate the Maghreb quicker§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173629;The Sultan has sent a regiment of Janissaries to aid us against the Moroccan aggressors, and promises us future support against invasion in exchange for the loyalty of our Dey. It would be wise for us to continue being loyal to the Sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173630;With the Moroccan invasion repulsed and Algerian victory in the Maghreb secure, the Beylik of Algiers and Beylik of Constantine have followed through on their promises and become loyal vassals of the Porte. With their loyalty ensured, Ottoman control over Algeria is assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173631;The defeat of the Janissaries sent as reinforcements to the Algerians has proven that the invincible Ottoman Empire have lost their touch after the Great Turkish War. Bested militarily and with no more Ottoman reinforcements in sight, the Algerian Beys were forced to submit and accept Moroccan rule. With Algeria under our control, the path to uniting the Maghreb under a Moroccan dynasty is closer to being realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173632;The Edirne Incident was a Janissary revolt that began in Constantinople in 1703. The revolt was a reaction to the consequences of the Treaty of Karlowitz and Sultan Mustafa II's absence from the capital. The rising power of the sultan’s former tutor, ªeyhülislam Feyzullah Efendi and the empire's declining economy caused by tax farming were also causes of the revolt. As a result of the Edirne Event, ªeyhülislam Feyzullah Efendi was killed, and Sultan Mustafa II was ousted from power. The sultan was replaced by his brother, Sultan Ahmed III. The Edirne Event contributed to the decline of the power of the sultanate and the increasing power of the janissaries and kadis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173633;A coalition of Georgian princes, under the leadership of Imeretian Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze, have stopped paying tribute to the Porte and have revolted against our rule. The Imeretian, Gurian, and Mingrelian kingdoms, aided by Abkhaz pirates, have begun raising armies and constructing forts in preparation for our response. Sultan Mustafa himself has raised a large army of Janissaries for the expedition to Georgia, which is sure to be a burden on the treasury. Large-scale responses of this nature are not commonplace for dealing with insubordination from Georgian princes. Perhaps such a response will help to finally cement Ottoman authority in the chaotic Georgian frontier.\n\n§RPutting down the revolt will annex Georgia and speed up your decisions to expand Georgian frontier, but will trigger a Janissary coup§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173634;After Ibrahim Sharif utilized Janissaries to assassinate Murad III and eradicate the Muradid dynasty in 1702, he took control of the Beylik of Tunis. However, his rule was tumultuous and did not have as popular the support as the Muradids. After a skirmish with the Dey of Algiers, Sharif was captured and taken to Algiers. In his absence Husayn ibn Ali, a Turkish Agha under Sharif, has siezed power for himself in the Beylik. Considering his heritage and the stability of his rule, the Sultan favored the rule of Husayn. However, Moroccan invaders have swiftly marched to Tunis and reinstalled Sharif as a puppet. Husayn ibn Ali has escaped and petitions us for Janissaries in his bid to recapture the Beylik.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173635;A regiment of Janissaries at his helm, Husayn quickly made for Tunis and rallied his supporters. Decisively shattering the Moroccan armies on the field of battle, Tunis was left to endure a lengthy siege. With no reinforcements, Tunis eventually fell and Ibrahim Sharif was captured and executed. With the Beylik once again secure, the Sublime Porte has recieved a confirmation of Husayn's fealty to the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC173636;Despite the best efforts of the usurper Husayn ibn Ali, Ibrahim Sharif has prevailed against the Janissary army sent to remove him, with Moroccan assistance of course. In a fortunate turn of events, Husayn was killed during the Janissary rout, and the Sublime Porte is out of options to retake Tunis. The Beylik is firmly under our control, and a united Maghreb seems all the more possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Charles II of Spain has produced no heirs, and with his health diminishing, the Habsburg and Bourbon claimants have begun to vy for the throne. If the Bourbon Philip of Anjou is to succeed the Spanish throne, the delicate balance of power in Europe will finally tip in favor of the ambitious Sun King, Louis XIV.

EVTDESC98002;Between the years of 1560 and 1658, Sweden created a Baltic empire centred on the Gulf of Finland and comprising the provinces of Karelia, Ingria, Estonia, and Livonia. During the Thirty Years' War Sweden gained tracts in Germany as well, including Western Pomerania, Wismar, the Duchy of Bremen, and Verden. During the same period, Sweden conquered Danish and Norwegian provinces north of the Sound. With the ascension of the young and inexperienced Charles XII, Sweden's rivals now look towards the Empire's posessions as easy targets. The ascendant Tsardom of Russia, fresh from the Great Turkish War and under the ambitious reign of Peter the Great, look towards the lands of Sweden with particular envy. Will the young Charles XII be able to protect Sweden from her partitioners, or is the Swedish Empire to fall to the manouvering of the ambitious Peter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1516004;The Spanish treasure fleet, or West Indies Fleet, was a convoy system of sea routes organized by the Spanish Empire from 1566 to 1790, which linked Spain with its territories in the Americas across the Atlantic. The convoys were general purpose cargo fleets used for transporting a wide variety of items, including agricultural goods, lumber, various metal resources such as silver and gold, gems, pearls, spices, sugar, tobacco, silk, and other exotic goods from the overseas territories of the Spanish Empire to the Spanish mainland. These fleets heavily contributed to the wealth of the Spanish Empire, and helped fund the expensive wars Spain found itself in the previous centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC151606;Túpac Amaru II and his supporters rallied near Cusco and siezed the local corregidor of Tinta, forcing the corregidor to secure arms and funds for the rebellion, then publically executing him.

His indigenous army has moved into the countryside and began mustering support for his rebellion, and now marches on Cuzco to take back the ancient Incan capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC151607;After an indigenous loyalist army under Jose del Valle decisively encircled the Incan army and repelled their breakout attempt, Túpac Amaru's family and closest generals were betrayed and delivered to the Spaniards. After torturing him for days, his wife and children were executed before he himself was quartered. With the destruction of their army and central eladers disperesed or dead, the Incan rebels could offer little resistance, and were eventually vanquished. To prevent another rebellion, the Spanish governance banned the Quechua language, the wearing of indigenous clothing, and any mention of Incan history and culture. Indigenous power structures such as the caciques were abolished, and indigenous rulership would never recover until the fall of the Spanish Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171146;In 1750 Charles-Louis de Secondat baron de La Montesquieu published the crowning achievement of his literary career - 'The Spirit of Laws.' This monumental 1086 page work was most celebrated for three of its numerous theories: the classification of governments, the political influence of climate, and the most important one, the theory of the separation of powers. Montesquieu argued that in the state that most effectively promotes liberty, the Legislative Executive and Judicial powers must be confided to different individuals or bodies acting independently. This idea was soon to become central to the Constitution of the United States.;x
EVTDESC171147;Encyclopédie, was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations.

He and the other contributors advocated for the secularization of learning away from the Jesuits.

Thus, it is an example of democratization of knowledge.;x
EVTDESC171148;We have considered that the Protestants, thus deprived of all legal existence, were faced with an impossible choice between profaning the sacraments by simulated conversions or compromising the status of their children by contracting marriages that were inherently null and void according to the legislation of our kingdom. The regulations have even assumed that there were only Catholics in our states; and this fiction, today inadmissible, has served as a motive for the silence of the law which would not have been able to legally recognize followers of another belief in France without either banishing them from the lands of our authority or providing right away for their civil status. Principles so contrary to the prosperity and tranquility of our kingdom would have multiplied the emigrations and would have excited continual troubles within families, if we had not provisionally profited from the jurisprudence of our courts to thrust aside greedy relatives who contested the children's rights to the inheritance of their fathers relying on the laws against Calvinists].

EVTDESC171142;France is filled with minorities that are ready to revolt at any moment, practicing heretic religions and no doubt conspiring against the very intrest of our nation! We should immedietly enforce policies that are going to prevent any mass-scale rebellion against them.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171109;After the end of the regency, the young King Louis has faced a difficult choice when it came to his advisor council. He knew he could not yet trust in his own ability to govern, so he resorted to appointing a prime minister.  Following the advice of his preceptor Fleury, Louis XV appointed his cousin Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, to replace the late Duke of Orléans. Eventually, the PM began to undermine Fleury's position at court. When the King became aware of the Duke's intrigue, he abruptly dismissed him and replaced him with Fleury.\n\n§BLouis Henri delays events related to the parlement rebellions.§!\n\n§GDe Fleury shortens the cooldown for enforcing french cultural unity.§!;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC171110;After Fleury's death in January 1743, his war minister, the Duke of Noailles, showed the King a letter that Louis XIV had written to his grandson, Philip V of Spain it counseled: "Don't allow yourself to be governed - be the master. Never have a favorite or a prime minister. Listen, consult your Council, but decide yourself. God, who made you King, will give you all the guidance you need, as long as you have good intentions." Louis followed this advice and decided to govern without a prime minister.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC171111;The Parlements were assemblies of nobles in Paris and older regions of France, whose members served as magistrates and judged civil cases. In 1761, the provincial Parlement of Normandy in Rouen wrote a protest to the King, explaining that the King had the exclusive power to tax, but the Parlement had the exclusive right to collect the money. The King rejected the explanation and overruled the Parlement, banished some of his most provocative Parlement members to their estates. For the rest of his reign, the Parlements swore allegiance to the King, but took every opportunity to resist his new taxes and the King's authority. This was one of the seeds of resistance to the King's authority that was to turn into a Revolution less than thirty years later.;;;;;;;;;;

All he wishes for in return is protection from the Ottoman Empire. Considering the strategic position of the principality, his loyalty may help us control the Black Sea.;x
EVTDESC173101;The Russo-Ottoman War of 1710-1711 broke out as a result of the Great Northern War, as Karl XII of Sweden and his retinue fled to the Ottoman fortress of Bender, in the Ottoman vassal principality of Moldavia, after their decisive defeat at Poltava. Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III declined incessant Russian demands for Charles's eviction, prompting Tsar Peter I to attack the Ottoman Empire, which in its turn declared war on Russia on 20 November 1710. Hospodar Dimitrie Cantemir of Moldavia and Tsar Peter signed the Treaty of Lutsk (13 April 1711), by which Moldavia pledged to support Russia in its war against the Ottomans with troops and by allowing the Russian army to cross its territory and place garrisons in Moldavian fortresses. In the summer of 1711, Peter led his army into Moldavia and united it with Cantemir's forces near the Moldavian capital Iasi; they then advanced southwards along the Pruth river. They aimed to cross the Danube, which marked the border between Moldavia and Ottoman territory proper.;x
EVTDESC173102;An immediate consequence of Cantemir's rebellion was the change in Ottoman policies towards the Christian vassals states of Moldavia and Wallachia. In order to consolidate the control over the two Danubian Principalities, the Ottomans would introduce direct rule through appointed Christian rulers (the so-called Phanariotes). The ruler Cantemir of Moldavia fled to Russia accompanied by a large retinue, and the Ottomans took charge of the succession to the throne of Moldavia by ignoring the boyars and appointing Nicholas Mavrocordatos, a Phanariote Greek, as ruler.;x
EVTDESC173103;The last Ottoman armies have crossed the Danube, routed and unable to recover their influence in the principality. Moldavia is now free from Ottoman oppression, and its ruler forced top agree to any of our demands. What shall be the fate of Moldavia?;x
EVTDESC173104;A delegation from the Wallachian principality has revealed to us his wishes to form an alliance with our great empire, and even become our loyal vassal. All he wishes for in return is protection from the Ottoman Empire. Considering the strategic position of the principality, his loyalty may help us control the Danube.;x
EVTDESC173105;Constantin Brâncoveanu, ruler of Wallachia, has apparently been colluding with enemies of the Porte and has attempted negotiations with the Habsburgs and Russians. Already, several of his boyars have fled to the Russian camp and offered their services to the Tsar. Even though Constantin denies responsibility for their betrayal and has attempted to regain the favor of the court, his conspiracies are jeapordizing our control of Wallachia.;x
EVTDESC173106;The ruler Constantin Brâncoveanu of Wallachia was accused by the Sultan of colluding with the enemy, and secretly enacting anti-Ottoman policies which were denounced by the Porte. Brâncoveanu was deposed from his throne by Sultan Ahmed III, and brought under arrest to Istanbul, where he was imprisoned in 1714 at the fortress of Yedikule. He and his four sons were beheaded in August, together with Prince Constantin's faithful friend, grand treasurer Enache Vacarescu. He would be replaced on the throne of Wallachia by the Greek Phanariote Nicholas Mavrocordatos in 1716.;x

EVTDESC1700006;On the night of 8 July 1762, one of Catherine's co-conspirators had been arrested by our police, revealing her involvement in the coup and confirming Peter's worst suspicions. Despite the involvement of the Church and the betrayal of the Ismailovsky Regiment, the conspiracy was quickly suppressed and Catherine imprisoned. Although Peter III's throne is safe for now, the victory has shown the weakness in his rule, and Russian society, especially the military, has been polarized by these events.;x
EVTDESC1700007;The ailing health of Peter III has declined severely in the past few months, and the writing is on the wall. On his deathbed, Peter III confirmed the succession of his children and peacefully passed away. A complex figure in Russian memory, his peaceful yet decadent reign may be soon be looked upon as a period of peace for Russia, although many reactionaries secretly wish that Catherine's coup had succeeded.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700008;In 1773, an organized insurrection of Yaik Cossacks headed by Yemelyan Pugachev, a disaffected ex-lieutenant of the Imperial Russian Army, attacked Samara and occupied it. Pugachev would go on to capture Kazan, with his captured territory stretching from the Volga to the Ural mountains. Though fairly well-organized for a revolt at the time, Pugachev's main advantage early on was the lack of seriousness about Pugachev's rebellion. Catherine the Great regarded the troublesome Cossack as a joke and put a small bounty of about 500 rubles on his head.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700009;Pugachev's Rebellion of 1773–1775 was the principal revolt in a series of popular rebellions that took place in the Russian Empire after Catherine II seized power in 1762. It began against a background of profound peasant unrest and war with the Ottoman Empire. After initial success, Pugachev assumed leadership of an alternative government in the name of the late Tsar Peter III and proclaimed an end to serfdom. The rebellion managed to consolidate support from various groups including the peasants, the Cossacks, and Old Believers priesthood. Various ethnic minorities such as Tatars, Cossacks, Bashkirs, and Kazaks fled to his cause due to rampant Russian discrimination and expansion.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700010;The Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) resulted in the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji, which made the Crimean Khanate independent from the Ottoman Empire and aligned it with the Russian Empire. The rule of the last Crimean khan Sahin Giray was marked with increasing Russian influence and outbursts of violence from the khan administration towards internal opposition. On 8 April 1783, in violation of the treaty, Catherine II intervened in the civil war, de facto annexing the whole peninsula as the Taurida Oblast. In 1787, Sahin Giray took refuge in the Ottoman Empire and was eventually executed, on Rhodes, by the Ottoman authorities for betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700011;The Russian Empire has offered our government control of Novorossiya, in order to manage the Tatar population and encourage Russian colonization of the frontier. Accepting the governance would effectively erode our Cossack identity and tie our paths with the Russian Empire fully, but the position offered to us will grant us signifcant power over the Black Sea.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1700013;Given the nature of the Wild Fields, our colonization efforts have been in vain, and repeateded Tatar and Cossack resistance to Russian settlers in the region has not helped increase our presence in the region. If we allowed the Cossacks governance of Novorossiya, perhaps they could make the frontier safe for colonization, and clear the path for a Russian Black Sea.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721009;In the last one and a half century, Sweden has rapidly risen to great power status. With a small yet professional army, the Swedes have built an empire with holdings on both sides of the Baltic by defeated its rivals in Moscow, Poland and Denmark along with numerous other German states.  Since the middle of the previous century, the King Charles XI had ruled Sweden. After the end of the devastating Scanian war in 1679, Charles XI devoted the rest of his life to avoiding further warfare by gaining larger independence in foreign affairs while he also promoted economic stabilization and a reorganization of the military. His remaining 20 years on the throne were thus the longest peacetime that Sweden experienced in recent history. With Charles's death in 1697, the throne passed to his 14 year old son Charles XII, a young party-hungry military enthusiast. Many doubt in his ability to rule the country effectivly but who knows, he may become a great monarch yet.;x
EVTDESC1721010;In 1718, Charles once more invaded Norway. With a main force of 40,000 men, he again laid siege to the fortress of Fredriksten overlooking the town of Fredrikshald. Charles was shot in the head and killed during the siege, while he was inspecting trenches. The invasion was abandoned, and Charles' body was returned to Sweden. A second force, under Carl Gustaf Armfeldt, marched against Trondheim with 10,000 men but was forced to retreat. In the march that ensued, many of the 5,800 remaining men perished in a severe winter storm. While in the trenches close to the perimeter of the fortress on 11 December, 1718, Charles was struck in the head by a projectile and killed. The shot struck the left side of his skull and exited from the right. He died instantly.;x
EVTDESC1721011;Charles XII Of Sweden invaded Russian-ruled Ukraine in 1708, but suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Poltava in the summer of 1709. He and his retinue fled to the Ottoman fortress of Bender, in the Ottoman vassal principality of Moldavia. Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III declined incessant Russian demands for Charles's eviction, prompting Tsar Peter I to attack the Ottoman Empire, which in its turn declared war on Russia on 20 November 1710.;x
EVTDESC1721012;Johann Reinhold Patkul was a Livonian nobleman, politician and agitator of Baltic German extraction. he protested against the manner of King Charles XI of Sweden's reduction in Livonia, enraging the king, who had him arrested and sentenced to mutilation and death. Patkul fled from the Swedish Empire to continental Europe, and played a key role in the secret diplomacy allying Peter I of Russia, Augustus II the Strong of Saxony and the Poland–Lithuania - as well as Christian V and his successor Frederick IV of Denmark–Norway - against Charles XII of Sweden, triggering the Great Northern War of 1700-1721. After the Treaty of Altranstädt in late 1706 he was forcefully extradited from Saxony. Patkul spent another year in Swedish detention before Charles XII had him broken on the wheel and decapitated.;x
EVTDESC1721013;The Hats and Caps were Swedish political factions active during the Age of Liberty (1719–1772). Their names derivee from the tricorne hat worn by officers and gentlemen. In 18th century Swedish politics, the Hats represented conservatives, the Caps represented liberals. The Hats, who ruled Sweden from 1738 to 1765, advocated an alliance with France and an assertive foreign policy, especially towards Russia. During their tenure, they involved Sweden in two expensive and disastrous wars, in the 1740s and 1750s. The foremost representative of the Age of Liberty, de facto leader of government and of the Caps from 1719 to 1738 was the Chancery President, Count Arvid Horn. Horn reversed the traditional policy of Sweden by keeping the Kingdom of France at a distance and drawing near to Russia. Thus a twenty years' war was succeeded by a twenty years' peace, during which the nation recovered so rapidly from its wounds that it began to forget them.;x
EVTDESC1721014;The death of the childless Charles XII left his younger sister Ulrika Eleonora in charge as Queen. The staunch parliamentarian, Chancellor Arvid Horn, immediately seized this opportunity to bring down the absolutism and strengthen the powers of Parliament. While his democratic leanings were in a way commendable, his actions were to completely destabilize Sweden and make her a puppet of foreign interests for the next 50 years. This so-called Age of Freedom also saw the aristocracy regain some of their lost ground. However, the young queen saw no clear alternative that would not upset her war weary people too much.;x
EVTDESC1721015;Swedish politics from 1721 to 1772 was dominated completely by the paralyzing bickering between the so-called Hat and Cap parties. The Caps, initially led by Arvid Horn, were backed by Russia and England, whereas the Hats were supported by France. The foreign meddling increased steadily, and when Gustavus III seized power in 1772 the most powerful political figure in Sweden was the Russian ambassador. At the Riksdag of 1738 the Hats managed to outmaneuver the peaceful Arvid Horn and seize power. Horn had made the mistake of renewing the defensive alliance of 1724 with Russia and at the same time trying to negotiate a subsidy treaty with France, which was still officially supporting Stanislaw Leszczynski against the Russians in Poland.;x
EVTDESC1721016;Following the death of Charles XII in the Great Northern War, and the abdication of his sister Ulrika Eleonora, after she relinquished most powers to the Riksdag of the Estates and chose to abdicate the role of the monarch in Sweden beceme increasingly less relevent. The consecutive powerless reigns and lack of legitimate heirs after the parliamentary government dominated by pro-revanchist Hat Party politicians ventured into a war with Russia, which ended in defeat and the Russian tsarina Elizabeth got Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp installed as a de-facto puppet king of Sweden.;x
EVTDESC1721017;The Riksdag stands paralyzed as the bickering Caps and Hats factions once again cannot come to terms with what direction should the nation take. On one hand the Caps are throwing ther lot indefinetly with Russia, trying to move the country in a more liberal direction. Their funding by Russia seems quite obvious as they even propose to appoint a Russian advisor as our minister of finances. On the other hand the French-backed Hats seem hellbent on another war with Russia, which might lead the country to ruin. In the end the only thing that's certain is that the parlamentarism doesn't seem to be working out too well in Sweden.;x
EVTDESC1721018;The Russo-Swedish War of 1741–1743 was instigated by the Hats, a Swedish political party that aspired to regain the territories lost to Russia during the Great Northern War, and by French diplomacy, which sought to divert Russia's attention from supporting its long-standing ally the Habsburg monarchy in the War of the Austrian Succession. As soon as hostilities ceased and the Russian army entered Turku, the statesmen Alexander Rumyantsev and Erik Mathias von Nolcken arrived at the city in order to discuss a peace settlement. The Tsarina promised to evacuate her army from Finland on the condition that Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp—that is, the uncle of her own heir apparent—was named as the heir to the throne of Sweden.;x
EVTDESC1721019;Dissatisfaction with the lords' government grew among the peasants during the Age of Liberty. The Russian victory of the Hats' Russian War of 1741-1743 and the question of succession after the childless Frederick I were the main reasons. The dissatisfaction was even stronger in the province of Dalarna where the Hats had introduced restrictions on the Dalecarlians' free trade with Norway. In 1743 the peasants of Dalarna rebelled in what became known as the Great Dalecarlian Dance. They were joined by the local regiment who had suffered heavy casualties at the bloody battle of Villmanstrand in 1741. The election of the Danish crown prince Frederick as king and a harsh inquisition against the generals responsible for the disastrous Russian War became the uprising's main objectives. The mob armed themselves and on 11 June started to march on Stockholm.;x
EVTDESC1721020;Gustavus III, the 'theater king', declared war on Russia in the summer of 1788. His main goals were to reclaim the honor of the Swedish military, retake some land that had been lost to Russia in previous wars and perhaps most importantly - put a stop to the incessant Russian meddling in Swedish politics. At the time, Sweden had a magnificent fleet and a rather effective army, but most of the officers could be described as politicians rather than soldiers. The Swedish army began marching on St. Petersburg and won some minor battles despite the compact resistance from the officers. On August 12 a group of 112 Finnish noble officers formed the 'Anjala League' and opened up negotiations with the Russians, declaring the war to be illegal and probing for the possibility of an independent Finnish state. This event effectively ended all hopes of a Swedish victory since the king was in a poor position to execute the traitors and have them replaced.;x
EVTDESC1721021;A large group of Finnish officers in the service of the Swedish king has sent us a dispatch declaring the ongoing war illegal and asking us if we would consider helping them form an independent nation of Finland. It could be useful as a buffer state...;x
EVTDESC1721022;After dissolving The Holy Roman Empire the resulting power vacuum ought to be filled by swedish presence. Hence forth any prince may willingly join the North German Leage Of Armed Neutrality and come under the protection of Sweden in return for economic benefits.\n\n§BNations with the North German primary culture can be annexed if they stay in our sphere of influence for a while.§!;x
EVTDESC1721023;Perhaps we should consider getting annexed by Sweden?;x
EVTDESC1721024;After our defeats against the Swedish Empire in the Thirty Years War, Pommerania firmly fell into the hands of the dominant Swedish Empire. However, with the advent of the Great Northern War and apparent weakness of the Swedish Empire, many in Prussia see it as an opportunity to reclaim Pommerania and evict Swedish influence in German lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721025;With our continued struggle in the Great Northern War, the vultures of the Holy Roman Empire have eyed our presence in Germany as an avenue for their own expansion. The vital Pomeranian port of Stralsund has fallen to the anti-Swedish coalition and Prussians, dashing any hopes within the Empire to save Pomerania. The question now is whether we should abandon Pomerania fully and refocus our efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1721026;Despite being a formal part of the Danish crown, in reality, the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp have ruled their lands relatively independent of Danish rule. It seems that independance has fed their delusions of where their loyalties should lie, as the duchy has sided with Sweden in the Great Northern War and refuses to march with us against Sweden. This rebellion threatens our southern domains, but such a distraction could threaten our campaign against Sweden.;x
EVTDESC1721027;With the advance of the Swedish and Polish armies into Ukraine, hetman Ivan Mazepa of the Cossack Hetmanate has approached us in secret talks, offering to abandon the Tsar and fight for the King. However, only 3,000 Cossacks have followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar. With such a meager army, should we even allow the Cossacks to serve under our banner, or give the territories of Mazepa to our Polish allies?;x
