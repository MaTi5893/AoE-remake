mobilzie_the_caroleans_desc;Caroleans were soldiers of the Swedish kings Charles XI and Charles XII. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, in order to compensate for its lack of manpower and resources, Sweden strove for innovative ways to make a more effective army. The tactics of Caroleans differed from those of Western European soldiers in their greater reliance upon pikes, rapiers, bayonets, and offensive strategy, which helped them to be victorious, even when greatly outnumbered, in many important Swedish battles. The Carolean army is regarded as one of the most effective military forces of their time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

constitutio_criminalis_theresiana_desc;Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana—the Criminal Code of Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria, promulgated in 1768, five years after the publication of Voltaire's famous essay “Essay on Toleration” (1763) where Voltaire objected to the “legally sufficient indications” of guilt that were allowed judges to proceed with judicial torture to extract a confession. The Theresiana was meant to introduce uniform criminal law and procedure throughout the Habsburg Crown Lands and remained in effect until the reforms of Emperor Joseph II in 1787. To that end, it included a series of appendices, which showed how judicial torture should properly be applied. (The law did not apply in Hungary);;;;;;;;;;;;;

charles_vi_court_desc;Charles was extremely discontented at the loss of Spain, and as a result, he mimicked the staid Spanish Habsburg court ceremonial, adopting the dress of a Spanish monarch, which, according to British historian Edward Crankshaw, consisted of "a black doublet and hose, black shoes and scarlet stockings";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Together with a number of other Cossack polkovnyks, Paliy and his rebels captured Bila Tserkva, Fastiv, Nemirov and a few other towns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
masepa_revolt_title;Mazepa rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
masepa_revolt_desc;The last straw in the souring relations with Tsar Peter was his refusal to commit any significant force to defend Ukraine against the Polish King Stanislaus Leszczynski, an ally of Charles XII of Sweden, who threatened to attack the Cossack Hetmanate in 1708. Peter expected that king Charles of Sweden was going to attack and thought that he could spare no forces. In the opinion of Mazepa, this blatantly violated the Treaty of Pereyaslav, since Russia refused to protect Ukraine's territory and left it to fare on its own;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_crimea_south_ukrine_title;Claim the Wild Fields;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_crimea_south_ukrine_desc;Wild fields is a geographical term for south Ukrainian lands. They are not too densely populated nor valuable, but that can change.

nueva_planta_decrees_title;Sign the Nueva Planta Decrees;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nueva_planta_decrees_desc;The Nueva Planta decrees were a number of decrees signed between 1707 and 1716 by Philip V, the first Bourbon king of Spain, during and shortly after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession by the Treaty of Utrecht.Angered by what he saw as sedition by the Aragonese, who had supported the claim of Charles of Austria to the Spanish thrones during the war and taking his native France as a model of a centralised state, Philip V suppressed the institutions, privileges, and the ancient charters (Spanish: fueros, Catalan: furs) of almost all the areas that were formerly part of the Crown of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands). The decrees ruled that all the territories in the Crown of Aragon except the Aran Valley were to be ruled by the laws of Castile ("the most praiseworthy in all the Universe" according to the 1707 decree), embedding those regions into a new and nearly uniformly administered, centralised Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

invite_germans_to_southern_border_desc;With our recent conquests of the wild fields we should begin settling the lands.

introduce_proper_consciption_title;Introduce Conscription;;;;;;;;;;;;;
introduce_proper_consciption_desc;Conscription of young Russian men for lifetime service began in 1699 during the rule of Peter the Great. The goal was to establish a standing army and increase its size for the emperor's many military campaigns.Conscription significantly differed for the wealthy and the lower classes. Each nobleman had to serve in the military, but city dwellers and peasants, who unlike the aristocracy paid a direct poll tax, faced a specific form of recruitment. The local commune selected only some men between 20 and 35 years old who would spend the rest of their lives in the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

vaccination_cat_desc;Catherine the Great of Russia was inoculated against smallpox by physician Thomas Dimsdale, with relays of horses at the ready in case the inoculation should go wrong and Dimsdale need to escape from Catherine's angry subjects.

louis_dream_desc;Louis ambition had always been grand from the beginning. He always argued that France's borders are ought to be consolidated and one of their mos vulnerable points was in the north west. Louis always wanted to extend the French border gar to the boundaries set by th Rhine river. Now we are finally in a position to do so, with our new territory in the lower Netherlands we will send a proclamation about our natural borders and rightful claims to them.

iqs_ireddentalism_title;Iroquois Irredentism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iqs_ireddentalism_desc;The Iroquois also came into conflict with the French in the later 17th century. The French were allies of their enemies, the Algonquins and Hurons, and after the Iroquois had destroyed the Huron confederacy in 1648–50, they launched devastating raids on New France for the next decade and a half. They were then temporarily checked by successive French expeditions against them in 1666 and 1687, but, after the latter attack, led by the marquis de Denonville, the Iroquois once again carried the fight into the heart of French territory, wiping out Lachine, near Montreal, in 1689. These wars were finally ended by a series of successful campaigns by New France’s governor, the comte de Frontenac, against the Iroquois in 1693–96. The time has come for us to retake our rightful lands to the west and put an end to the western colonists;;;;;;;;;;;;;

abolish_mughal_supremacy_desc;The final fall of the Mughal banner from Delhi ended their empire but not their Timurid legacy. Even now, the entire India continues to live under the shadow of its Mughal past. Their institutions, their laws and their titles are still being honourably maintained by many of the newly independent princes and many Mughal princes continue to harbour dreams of reconquest from exile. It is time we start a campaign of words to slowly and surely erase their legacy and rid India of the Mughal plaque once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At that time they called him "The mountain rat" or "The bandit". But today we Marathas rule a huge realm full of diverse people's and cultures. Our army is a pride of India. Now it's time to declare ourselves as a real Empire. A proud Empire with its own laws, its own institutions and its own power. At last Chhatrapati Shivaji's legacy has come a full circle. We bow to his great soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

restore_claim_on_yemen_desc;Yemen was an integral dominion of the old Axum kingdom, the nation we will always seek to emulate.

agricultural_revolution_title;Begin The Agricultural Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
agricultural_revolution_desc;The British Agricultural Revolution, or Second Agricultural Revolution, was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as the population more than tripled to over 35 million.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
begin_encolsure_title;Complete the process of Enclosure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
begin_encolsure_desc;In Europe, agriculture was feudal from the Middle Ages. In the traditional open field system, many subsistence farmers cropped strips of land in large fields held in common and divided the produce. They typically worked under the auspices of the aristocracy or the Catholic Church, who owned much of the land. As early as the 12th century, some fields in England tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields. The Black Death from 1348 onward accelerated the break-up of the feudal system in England. Many farms were bought by yeomen who enclosed their property and improved their use of the land. More secure control of the land allowed the owners to make innovations that improved their yields. Other husbandmen rented property they "share cropped" with the land owners. Many of these enclosures were accomplished by acts of Parliament in the 16th and 17th centuries, and we can clearly see the benefits of it today. Let us finish the process once and for all and walk into a new age;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He was the person most responsible for the reforms that created the force which served in the Peninsular War. He was also in charge of the preparations against Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom in 1803. In the opinion of Sir John Fortescue, Frederick did "more for the army than any one man has done for it in the whole of its history". In 1801 Frederick actively supported the foundation of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, which promoted the professional, merit-based training of future commissioned officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

begin_agricilture_reforms_title;Begin the Agriculture Reforms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
begin_agricilture_reforms_desc;During the time of Gustaf Vasa in the 16th century, who took a personal interest in the improvement of the royal properties, a period of agricultural flourishing started, and Sweden was regularly a cereal-exporting country. This lasted until the wars of Charles XII in the early 18th century, which took a heavy toll on the countryside population and meant that the cereal-producing Baltic provinces were lost. By the mid-18th century land reforms were initiated (storskiftet) which meant that scattered land plots around villages were progressively redistributed into coherent holdings, which gave the possibility for more rational farming. Swedish scientists also gave attention to the improvement of agriculture, with botanist Carl Linnaeus and agricultural chemist Johan Gottschalk Wallerius as the foremost representatives. However, the mercantilist views of the era guided most governmental activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
commodity_act_title;Impose the Commodity Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;
commodity_act_desc;Like other European states the during the early 18th century, Sweden followed a mercantilist trade policy. This dictated that economic success of a nation was derived from strong state control over the economy, having more exports than imports, and striving for self-sufficiency. In the Swedish Empire, foreign trade was prohibited in all inland towns. Goods had to be first sold to “staple towns” before they could be traded internationally. In Sweden there were over 20 such towns, the most active being Stockholm and Gothenburg, while in Finland only Helsinki, Turku, and Hamina had the same rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

moose_cavalry_title;Introduce the Moose Cavalary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
moose_cavalry_desc;The moose had been used in Sweden to draw the sleighs of the Royal couriers since at least the reign of Charles IX. They proved effective in this role, able to travel around 230 miles (370 km) in a day. Some sources state that as a development of this role Charles XI (1660–1697) trialled the use of moose cavalry. The intention was apparently to replace the horses of one of his cavalry regiments with moose, to avoid the need to import horses as was the contemporary practice. It is said to have been thought that the animals would cause fear in the horses of enemy cavalry, allowing formations to be broken without the need for artillery or musketry. The idea is ought presented to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, in December he grew impatient, and on the 10th of that month he abolished the council of state. A week later he appointed himself maître des requetes. It became his official duty to present reports from the various departments of state to the king. Because King Christian was scarcely responsible for his actions, Struensee dictated whatever answers he pleased. Next, he dismissed all department heads, and abolished the Norwegian viceroyship. Henceforth the cabinet, with himself as its motive power, became the one supreme authority in the state. Struensee held absolute sway for almost thirteen months, between 18 December 1770 and 16 January 1772. During this time he issued no fewer than 1069 cabinet orders, or more than three a day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

korean_border_title;1717 Qing-Joseon border treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
korean_border_desc;After years of useless bickering and disputes, the matter of the Sino-Korean border is to be decided from the highest pedestals of authority in both nations. The Kangxi Emperor and the Joseon of Korea have both sent their diplomats and agreed to bring an end to this border conflict once and for all. The Qing delegation is led by Mukedeng, and the Joseon delegation is led by Pak Kwon. Befre the meet, the two have held a joint commission to survey and demarcate the boundaries between the two states. After extensive geographic surveys and travels up and down the rivers Yalu and Tyumen, the delegates have finally assembled the information and the meeting has begun. The Koreans claim that the territories held by the 7th century Gorguryeo dynasty north of the river are true and that those boundaries should be restored. However giving in to their demands would be seen as a sign of weakness which might harm us in future diplomacy. Our own claims extend a little south of the river in accordance with the territories claimed by the Manchu Jaegaseung monks as their homeland. But trying to enforce these claims might antagonize the Koreans and may lead to needless violence. Instead, diplomats from both sides also propose a simple third solution. To mark the boundary on the river instead. A simple river dividing two great dynastic empires!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

catharine_the_greats_reforms_desc;Catherine reformed the administration of Russian guberniyas (governorates), and many new cities and towns were founded on her orders. An admirer of Peter the Great, Catherine continued to modernize Russia along Western European lines. However, military conscription and the economy continued to depend on serfdom, and the increasing demands of the state and of private landowners intensified the exploitation of serf labour. This was one of the chief reasons behind rebellions, including the large-scale Pugachev Rebellion of Cossacks, nomads, peoples of Volga and peasants. The period of Catherine the Great's rule, the Catherinian Era, is considered a Golden Age of Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

soldier_king_reforms_dec_desc;Frederick William I did much to improve Prussia economically and militarily. He replaced mandatory military service among the middle class with an annual tax, and he established schools and hospitals. The king encouraged farming, reclaimed marshes, stored grain in good times and sold it in bad times. He dictated the manual of Regulations for State Officials, containing 35 chapters and 297 paragraphs in which every public servant in Prussia could find his duties precisely set out: a minister or councillor failing to attend a committee meeting, for example, would lose six months' pay; if he absented himself a second time, he would be discharged from the royal service. In short, Frederick William I concerned himself with every aspect of his relatively small country, ruling an absolute monarchy with great energy and skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;

yongzheng_emperor_reforms_title;Emperor Yongzheng's Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
yongzheng_emperor_reforms_desc;After ascending to the throne in 1723 Yongzheng moved rapidly. First, he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and reversed what he saw as his father's laxness by cracking down on unorthodox sects and by decapitating an anti-Manchu writer his father had pardoned. In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries, though some were allowed to remain in the capital. Next, he moved to control the government. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials, which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and he created a small Grand Council of personal advisors, which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for "money to nourish honesty" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These brilliant military successes brought no comparable political results in their train, and the Senate recalled Emo and his fleet to Corfu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such militias were subsequently organised in many localities and formed, together with Patriot political clubs, the core of the Patriot movement. From 1785 on, the Patriots managed to gain power in a number of Dutch cities, where they replaced the old system of co-option of regenten with a system of democratically elected representatives. This enabled them to replace the representatives of these cities in the States of several provinces, gaining Patriot majorities in the States of Holland, Groningen and Utrecht, and frequently also in the States General.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

enforce_navigation_acts_desc;The Navigation Acts, or more broadly the Acts of Trade and Navigation, was a long series of English laws that developed, promoted, and regulated English ships, shipping, trade, and commerce between other countries and with its own colonies. The laws also regulated England's fisheries and restricted foreigners' participation in its colonial trade. While based on earlier precedents, they were first enacted in 1651 under the Commonwealth. The system was reenacted and broadened with the restoration by the Act of 1660, and further developed and tightened by the Navigation Acts of 1663, 1673, and 1696. Upon this basis during the 18th century, the Acts were modified by subsequent amendments, changes, and the addition of enforcement mechanisms and staff.The Acts generally prohibited the use of foreign ships, required the employment of English and colonial mariners for 75% of the crews, including East India Company ships. The Acts prohibited colonies from exporting specific, enumerated, products to countries other than Britain and those countries' colonies, and mandated that imports be sourced only through Britain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
