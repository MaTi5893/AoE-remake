EVTDESC100000;Mandate of Heaven. The concept present in China throughout millennia. It is said that if the heavens anger fall on China, manifested by disasters and decadence, it is the right of the people to depose the "Son of Heaven", and bring back the balance. And even though China is under the rule of foreign dynasty this principle still holds true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100001;The people see our rule as successful and prosperous, thus they consider that our Mandate of Heaven is high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100002;Our popularity among the people isn't great but it also isn't terrible, we can assume that our Mandate of Heaven is average.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100003;The rule of our celestial emperor is now seen as a disaster after a disaster, our Mandate of Heaven is low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100004;Peoples anger is growing, we can only hope that this won't diminish our Mandate too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100005;When people's stomachs are full they are happy, and when they are happy they are easier to rule, thus our Mandate may only grow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100006;Floods aren't uncommon in China but this one... is something else... People depend on the government and it's bureaucracy to maintain irrigation and control the rivers, maybe we have neglected it or maybe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100007;China art of rule has always been unique, it's administration was often meritocratic and based on state exams, and even though it was, also, often corrupt due to insufficient founding, this time it is different, people are praising our dynasty for fair and just rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100008;The worst has come! The heavens have truly abandoned us and whole China has risen in revolt against Manchu yoke, both native Chinese aristocracy and peasant leaders have declared rebellion on us, styling themselves as "Blue Turbans" in memory of their both yellow and red predecessors. Our enemies are numerous and among them are heirs to the Ming throne and descendants of famous Confucius.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100009;We have accomplished total victory over Manchu, let's hope that China may now rest in peace, free from foreign oppression...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100012;We may have hoped for peace but it seems that our desired bliss is away from us, now that the Qing dynasty fell there is now unifying force between the Blue Turbans. The strife for spoils of war has begun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100010;The rebels have been crushed mercilessly and now none can oppose the "Son of Heaven"! It is only a matter of time until all of China is brought back under our administration...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100013;How could we have lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100014;The rebellion have ravaged the Chinese countryside but besides that, besides the countless life lost, no side was able to achieve total victory... Will China stay fragmented, will the "Rebels" jump into each others throats, will they unite once again against the barbaric dynasty.... Only time will tell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100015;We have a wide variety of historical capitals to choose from...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC100018;The war has come into a halt and finally our conscripted soldiers may return to their fields and work on them again, as it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
