EVTNAME185;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Prohibition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC185;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Temperance League has been increasingly active in one of our states this year, with a campaign to harass local public houses and liquor merchants. Many of their more politically-minded members have even approached members of the government in $CAPITAL$, pushing for greater support for their campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME186;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Libertines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC186;The libertine culture in $COUNTRY$ has drawn criticism, with news of a scandal that reaches to the very heights of government. Several ministers are accused of unsavory dealings, and there are calls in $CAPITAL$ for the government to support religious groups in their calls for moderation and temperance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2600;$STATENAME$ Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2600;$COUNTRY$ has maintained control over $STATENAME$ for us to consider the possibility of integrating it into $COUNTRY$ as a whole. There are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags waving in $PROVINCENAME$, flown by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, so it does not seem so far-fetched an idea that $STATENAME$ be eventually considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory by the world at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2605;$PROVINCENAME$ Integrated into $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2605;$COUNTRY$ has controlled $PROVINCENAME$ for a long time-- long enough for those within $PROVINCENAME$ to truly consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and for the rest of the world to consider the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ claim to the province to be legitimate as well. Though there are still some unhappy with the development, $PROVINCENAME$ is now considered an integral part of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2610;$STATENAME$ Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2610;$STATENAME$ is considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory-- that is only in dispute by those neighbours who still have recognized claims on the area, and who maintain that many within $STATENAME$ consider themselves citizens of their country and not ours. The first step in rendering their claim invalid would be to enact a policy that encourages the assimilation of all people within $STATENAME$... they should be $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and hold no other nationality above ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2611;Assimilation Policies Rescinded;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2611;With the new government in power and its more liberal views on minorities within $COUNTRY$, the policies of assimilation that attempted to stamp out minorities of other nationalities have all been rescinded. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military who warn that this is a dangerous idea, and that allowing these foreign identities to perpetuate will only lead to further conflict with our neighbours-- but, for now, their voices have been ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2615;Flags Burned in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2615;A demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them-- a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$. Authorities broke up the demonstration, but there continues to be a growing discontent in the area. The turmoil has even spread to other citizens, who have begun calling on the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to end its assimilation policies and let the minority groups be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2616;Incident in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2616;The recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbours with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least-- riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2620;Flags Flying in $PROVINCENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2620;A parade has recently taken place in $PROVINCENAME$, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag flying high-- and being held by people who, until very recently, likely wouldn't have considered themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens at all. $PROVINCENAME$ is still claimed by another country, but the acceptance of $PROVINCENAME$'s people is going a long way towards making elimination of that an inevitable fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2625;$PROVINCENAME$ Assimilated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2625;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag is the only one that can now be found flying in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. At long last, it can be considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and only $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. Even those who are members of other cultures no longer consider themselves truly part of our neighbours-- much as those neighbours might be unhappy with the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2626;Claims in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2626;$FROMCOUNTRY$ continues to hold some of our lands, lands which until today have always been considered part of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ national territory. A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ program of assimilation has succeeded, however, in weaning our own people away from any feeling as if this true. They no longer consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$, and indeed the international community appears to agree with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2650;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to them-- and only the ones that belong to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2651;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to another nation-- but only those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2660;Our Lands Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2660;As a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim. Any others should, by all rights, be returned to $FROMCOUNTRY$.\n\n§RNOTE: If you took $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ core provinces which are not also your own core provinces in this war, enacting the 'return' option will give those lands back. Be careful!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10100_NEW;Phytophthora infestans, the dreaded potato blight, has struck one of our farming provinces. Starving smallholders, and in some places driving whole families from their homes, the potato blight has caused a localized famine that threatens to spread.;;Phytophthora infestans, die gefürchtete Kartoffelfäule, ist in $PROVINCENAME$ ausgebrochen. Die Krankheit bringt lokale Kleinbauern ans Hungertuch, treibt an manchen Orten ganze Familien aus ihren Heimen, und hat generell vor Ort eine Hungersnot ausgelöst, die sich auszubreiten droht. Im Parlament wie auch vor Ort treten die Liberalen vor, klagen unsere Regierung an, die Hungerhilfe ungeschickt anzugehen, und behaupten, dass vielleicht nicht die Knollenfäule selbst, sondern unsere Politik, die zu Nahrungsmangel geführt hat, an der Krise schuld ist.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC10140_NEW;Liberal causes have started to gain traction in $COUNTRY$. While no one knows for sure, rumor has it that the root cause of this sudden upswing in liberal propaganda efforts is the recent foundation of a secret society, forced into hiding due to the persecution of any legitimate opposition to the ruling party. Whether it be the Rosecrucians or the Illuminati, these society members will continue to act from the shadows until $COUNTRY$ allows free debate and opposition in its politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10150_NEW;The smog from the factories hangs low against the blood red of a charcoal sky. Far away in the depths of the city, in the deepest bowels of the industrial machine, the cries and shouts of a forming mob can be heard echoing against a backdrop of drainpipes and smokestacks. Infuriated over poor working conditions, clamoring for a return to a lost pastoral dream remembered, Luddites take to the streets in $COUNTRY$.;;Der kohlschwarze Qualm der Fabriken hängt tief gegen den blutroten Himmel. Tief im Herzen der Stadt, in den untersten Kellern der Industriemaschine, kann man die Schreie und Rufes des sich bildenden Mobs im Echo gegen den Hintergrund von Kühlröhren und Schornsteinen hören. Erzürnt über schlechte Arbeitsbedingungen ziehen die Ludditen auf die Straße in $COUNTRY$ und verlangen die Wiederkehr eines ländlichen Traums.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10160_NEW;Immorality is like water, flowing through every concievable crack in the dams of legal authority. Liberals in $COUNTRY$ have, on account of the ban on public meetings, begun holding banquets.

EVTDESC10200_NEW;Death to the $MONARCHTITLE$!', a hoarse voice cries. The streets in $PROVINCENAME$ have come alive. A local injustice, or the perception of one, have animated the unwashed masses into rebellion against our rule and threatens to spread to the rest of the state. The revolt is still small enough that its future course has not been set in stone, and leniency might avert it, but perhaps it is best to put our foot down firmly to set an example?;;Tod dem König!', schreit eine heisere Stimme. Die Straßen in $PROVINCENAME$ sind zum Leben erwacht. Eine lokale Ungerechtigkeit bzw. das, was manche dafür ansehen, hat eine Rebellion der ungewaschenen Horden gegen unsere Herrschaft entfacht.

Mit Milde könnte man noch etwas erreichen, aber vieleicht ist es am besten, hart vorzugehen, um ein Exempel zu statuieren?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10205;Fighting in the Streets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10205;Tensions in one of our provinces reached a boiling point recently, with liberals and reactionaries battling in the streets. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police were quick to move in, but tempers remain high and already there are reports of fighting elsewhere in the state. Officials are calling for decisive action to put an end to the violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10215;Inspired Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10215;Nationalists in $COUNTRY$, inspired by the wave of liberalism in a neighboring nation, have risen up. Agitators are running through the streets waving flags and calling for their brethren to fight for freedom. Responding with violence could enflame the entire state, but $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials agree that this cannot be allowed to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10155;Pan-Nationalist Fervor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10155;A fervor has been sweeping through parts of $COUNTRY$, with liberal-minded revolutionaries calling for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens to rise up and demand the unification of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$.

EVTNAME10221;Chartist Rally in Kennington Common;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10221;A massive demonstration by the Chartists has taken place in Kennington Common, with liberals demanding that the People's Charter be implemented immediately-- giving equal votes to all men, rich or poor, as well as secret ballots and a fair distribution of constituencies. Many in the government are suggesting that such public gatherings should be made illegal, and that at best the British government should make empty promises to these rabble-rousers. Others fear that refusing their demands will lead to the monarchy being toppled by rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10222;The French Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10222;Angry crowds have flooded the streets of Paris, shouting cries of 'Down with the King!' and 'Long live the Reform!'. They have erected barricades in the streets and fighting has broken out with the Parisian municipal guards. With the city having been completely closed off from outside help, these crowds have begun to march on the royal palace. Our king has had no choice but to abdicate and flee the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10223;Louis-Napoleon's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10223;Facing the prospect of losing the presidential election, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10224;Emperor Napoleon Deposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10224;Angered by the inability of France to prevent the formation of Germany, as well as the humiliating loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the government has deposed Emperor Napoleon. We must choose what form our new government is to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10225;Hungarian Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10225;The Hungarian Diet has grown increasingly independent of Austrian rule in recent years. Field Marshall Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg was sent to Hungary to take personal control over their armies, but was attacked upon his arrival. In response, the Austrian government ordered the Hungarian Diet dissolved and the Ban of Croatia installed in Lamberg's place. The Hungarians have refused to obey, and thus we now face civil war to maintain the integrity of the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10226;Freedom At Last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10226;We have won our freedom from Austrian rule! The people have gathered in $CAPITAL$ in jubilation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10227;The Hungarian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10227;Hungarian lands rightfully belong to us. With their new-found freedom, we are left with the decision whether we should pursue our claim to their lands or instead try to reconcile with the Hungarian government. If they remain hostile, after all, and we are unable to defeat them, they will become a very dangerous enemy on our border. Admitting their loss, however, might be a blow to our prestige we will never recover from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10228;Constitutional Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10228;With the entire nation ready to overthrow the monarchy, ministers have approached the King with advice on reforming the constitution before it's too late. The loss of Belgium has made a revision necessary already. Including provisions that permitted the direct election of the lower house as well as numerous freedoms the Dutch do not already enjoy might pacify the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10229;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10229;With the people seemingly ready to break down our doors, demanding constitutional reform, perhaps we should consider giving it to them? Some moderate reforms, allowing the masses their vote but retaining ultimate power for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocracy and the Kaiser, should please them enough to dispel this rabble... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10400;The French Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10400;The unrest in France hit its height recently, with crowds streaming through the streets of Paris and erecting barricades. In what was widely regarded as an accident, a French guardsmen fired his musket on the citizens and set off a massacre. The resulting conflagaration has swept the city, with crowds chanting 'Long live the Reform!' and 'Down with the King!'. Despite assurances that everything is under control, the king has abdicated and fled the country… leaving a provisional government to step in and declare the Second Republic.\n\nNow we have the task of building this new government, starting with a presidential election to determine its new Head of State. Considering the popularity of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte among the masses, and the granting of universal voting rights, some are concerned that he may in fact take the leadership. If he does, who knows what this may mean for France?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10401;The Presidential Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10401;While it was expected that Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte would do well in the French presidential election, no one could have counted on the fact that he has done as well as this. Despite his autocratic leanings and lack of allies in Paris, he has managed to be something to everyone… even gaining the sponsorship of the Orleanists. The provisional government's candidate, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, led the effort to quell an uprising in the city-- leading to resentment among the masses which has translated into Napoleon's landslide. Many fear the man takes too much after his infamous uncle, and thus the idea has arisen of fixing the elections to ensure Cavaignac's victory. This would require us to restrict universal sufferage, as well as muffle the newspapers and political opponents. Either way, the ideals of the Second Republic seem at risk of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10402;Napoleon Wins Election!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10402;Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte has swept into power as France's new Head of State. The man carries with him the legacy of his infamous uncle, and with it the support of the masses. He has no friends in Paris, however, almost all of whom are nervous of the possibility that he might decide to follow in his uncle's footsteps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10405;Louis-Napoleon's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10405;Unable to force the Upper House to repeal its prohibition against presidential re-election and facing removal from power, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10410;Emperor Napoleon Deposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10410;The popularity of Louis-Napoleon has waned. Where once it was expected that his ascension would return France to the greatness it experienced during the reign of his uncle, instead France sees itself being eclipsed by its neighbours. The Emperor has cultivated many enemies among the liberals in Paris, and now they have chosen their moment to strike. Napoleon has been deposed, and the only question remains as to what form France shall now take. Shall we restore the Bourbon dynasty under the Count of Chambord, elect for a Bourbon constitutional monarchy under the Comte de Paris, or instead opt to create the Third Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10411;The Death of Napoleon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10411;Louis-Napoleon has grown ill in recent months, slowly surrendering more and more ground to the Upper House. Thus his death comes with no surprise to many. Mourned by the entire nation, and by his beloved Empress Eugénie, the question now turns to who will follow him. His son and heir would be Napoleon IV… but he is still a young man, eager to live up to the legacy left him. Others favor the popular Bourbon Count of Paris. Still more, however, claim this is the perfect moment to restore the republic and end the monarchy once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11100_NEW;The Unification of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11100_NEW;A rising tide of liberal nationalism within $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ has begun to spread, raising the idea of a $UNION_ADJ$ union with $COUNTRY$ at its head. A parliament of liberal revolutionaries has been convened, with representatives from throughout $UNION_ADJ$ lands, which has decreed the time is right for the nation to unite under one banner. The parliament has offered the crown of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ to us. We could accept the offer, but doing so would cause international alarm, and require us to compensate the revolutionaries politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11104;Revolution in $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11104;A pro-$UNION_ADJ$ revolution has taken hold in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Its liberal leaders believe that $COUNTRY$ is the nation best-suited to unite all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, and thus have sworn to support us until the union is ready to occur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11106;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11106;$MONARCHTITLE$, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador has presented us with news from the recent parliament of German revolutionaries. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to assemble a federation of German states, with the goal of eventually forming a greater Germany. If we do not agree,it is possible that $FROMCOUNTRY$ will attempt to take our lands by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11108;Slavic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11108;The call has gone out for the Slavic nations of the Balkans to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Austrians and Turks as well as other European powers. Yugoslavia, it is said, will be a power to rival even its most powerful neighbours. Whether this new nation would succeed in holding together a people divided by centuries of bitter warfare is best left for speculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11109;The Creation of Greater Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11109;The call has gone out for the Ugric nations of Greater Finland to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Russians as well as other European powers. This new nation, it is said, will be a power to rival even its most powerful neighbours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11110;A North German Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11110;An open discussion amongst liberals in $COUNTRY$ has been occurring regarding the formation of a confederation of North German states. Conditions have never been right for it in the past, but many believe such a union is needed if the Germans are ever to have true security and take their place among the powers of the world. A $COUNTRY_ADJ$-led movement to create such a confederation might go over well with our neighbours, if we made the attempt to create it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11115;The Greater Slavic Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11115;Many within $COUNTRY$ have always considered it a dream to form a greater union of the Slavic peoples, one spanning all of the Balkans and uniting them under a common flag. Such a nation would be far better suited at resisting the encroachment of foreign powers into the region. Now seems like the perfect opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to form such a union. Do we proceed with the creation of Yugoslavia, or let the dream die here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11120;Slavic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11120;The call has come to $COUNTRY$ to unite with Yugoslavia, a union of Slavic countries interested in protecting the Balkans from the encroachment of other European powers. Whether a union of cultures which have before now often been at war, and indeed still have considerable enmity for each other, will be difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19006;Our independence is gradually being undercut and more and more becoming something that only exists on paper, as several foreign Great Powers vie for control over our political institutions. Recently, tensions have erupted between several great powers each vying for dominance over our government. If any of them attempts to assert themselves in $COUNTRY$, it will mean conflict with our government, the other great powers, and possibly even war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The more precise origin of these shipwrecked sailors is as of yet uncertain, but, wherever they are from, they are definitely not from $COUNTRY$. The difficulty now lies in deciding what to do with them: if we send them home, we are effectively changing our policy of non-interaction with the westerners. Ignoring them and allowing them to stay, however, means permitting a western presence in $COUNTRY$ despite all our efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC13015;One of our subjects has been discovered wearing foreign clothes, and further interrogation by the authorities has lead to the slow unraveling of a foreign smuggling ring. These foreigners come into $COUNTRY$ without permission, knowing they face execution should they be caught-- yet some of our advisors say there are benefits to their presence, as they can supply needs to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people that we cannot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13016;Smugglers Sell Opium;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13016;In what should come as no surprise, the foreign smuggling ring in one of our provinces has been caught red-handed selling opium to the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13020;Foreign Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13020;Despite our policy of not permitting foreigners into $COUNTRY$, it has been discovered that a group of foreign missionaries has been traveling among our people and spreading their religion. While we have every right to execute them out of hand, this does raise the possibility of a confrontation with their home country. Do we wish to risk such a war, all for the sake of a few priests?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13021;Missionaries Executed in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13021;We have received reports that a number of our missionaries have been executed in $FROMCOUNTRY$, part of a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ action to round up all unwanted foreigners. The missionaries were peaceful, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public is understandably enraged. Many believe that war is necessary, while others believe the potential for war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ simply isn't worth it. The missionaries knew they were not permitted in $FROMCOUNTRY$, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13030;Western Approaches;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13030;News reaches us that an expatriate community of foreigners, from various European countries and Great Powers, has formed in one of our cities. Doubtlessly, this is a direct effect of our government's policy of open ports and borders. This influx might be positive, as our government seems to believe, however some voices have less kind things to say about the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13031;Grievous Insults!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13031;A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who left $COUNTRY$ some time ago on an expedition to $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been viciously refused entry to the country. It appears that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has turned gradually to a policy of increasing isolationism, most likely in order to avoid the pains of modernizing their political, economical and social institutions. This policy of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is, obviously, impairing the advances of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ trade, diplomacy and missionary activities in the region, and must be considered an unjust restriction of the international freedom of movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13040;Despite the obvious rightness of our country's trade policies, greater amounts of foreign goods could be useful, and elements within our administration have suggested setting up a limited trading post in one of our coastal cities, where foreign ships can moor and trade, without compromising the cultural integrity of $COUNTRY$. It could be an economic boon to the area and the nation, but conservative voices warn that destructive foreign influences might further creep into our society.;;Trotz der offensichtlichen Richtigkeit unserer Isolationspolitik könnte eine gewisse Menge ausländischer Güter uns von Nutzen sein.

The European traders have brought with them the habit of opium smoking, and our subjects have taken to it on a scale that threatens to become epidemic. It seems that, for every new ship that lands, more and more of our people get caught in the deadly and pacifying web of addiction. What should we do?;;Ein süßlich-stechender Gestank hängt über den Hintergassen und -gossen in $PROVINCENAME$ und verbreitet sich von einem Epizentrum an der ausländischen Handelsstation in alle Richtungen aus. Die europäischen Händler haben die Gewohnheit des Opiumrauchens mit sich gebracht, und unsere Untertanen haben sie auf eine Stufe erhöht, die zu einer Epidemie zu werden droht. Es scheint, dass mit jedem neuen Schiff, das ankert, mehr und mehr unserer Untertanen sich im tödlichen Netz der Sucht verstricken. Was sollen wir tun?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13051;Smugglers Dodge Trade Restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13051;Due to the trade restrictions on the sale of opium, a number of western merchants have instead gone underground. We have word that a group of them have set up shop in one of our coastal provinces, but so far none of the locals seem willing to come forth with information. If we allow the smuggling ring to remain, it seems only a matter of time before the opium problem spreads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13056;The great clippers ply our coastlines from north to south, like wolves culling out the weak and the corruptible with the poison they sell. Wherever there is an unexposed harbor, a foreign ship soon docks, and drives another fang into our national body. The use of opium has spread throughout $STATENAME$.;Les grands voiliers de commerce sillonent nos côtes du nord au sud, comme des loups à l'abattage des faibles et des corruptibles avec le poison qu'ils vendent. Partout où il y a un port non encore exposé, un navire étranger accoste bientôt, et plante un autre croc dans notre organisme national. L'usage de l'opium s'est étendue à $PROVINCENAME$. ;Die großen Klipper fahren unsere Küste von Norden nach Süden ab, wie Wölfe, die sich die Schwächsten aus der Herde suchen - in diesem Fall die mit ihrem wohlfeilen Gift Korrumpierbaren. Wo immer sich ein neuer Hafen findet, ankert bald ein ausländisches Schiff und rammt einen weiteren Reißzahn in den Körper unserer Nation. Der Opiumgebrauch hat sich nach $PROVINCENAME$ ausgebreitet.;;Los grandes veleros clíper navegan por nuestras costas, recorriéndolas de norte a sur, como lobos que acechan a los débiles y corruptibles con el veneno que venden. Cuando encuentran un puerto desprotegido, un barco extranjero atraca y clava su colmillo en el cuerpo de nuestra nación. El uso del opio se ha extendido a $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13061;The use of opium in a neighboring province has now spread to the inland. Farmers and laborers throughout $STATENAME$ fail to turn up for work, and entire fields fall fallow, as the people slip further and further down into the mists of consuming dependence.;L'usage de l'opium dans une province voisine s'est maintenant étendue à l'intérieur de ses terres. Les fermiers et ouvriers ne parviennent plus à se présenter au travail, et des champs entiers retombent en friche, les gens de $PROVINCENAME$ glissent de plus en plus dans les brumes de la dépendance. ;Der Gebrauch von Opium in einer Nachbarprovinz hat sich nun ins Inland ausgebreitet. Bauern und Arbeiter in $PROVINCENAME$ erscheinen nicht mehr zur Arbeit, und komplette Felder liegen brach, als die Menschen in $PROVINCENAME$ tiefer und tiefer in den Nebel der verzehrenden Sucht sinken.;;El uso del opio en una provincia vecina se ha extendido al interior. Los granjeros y los peones de $PROVINCENAME$ no han vuelto al trabajo, y las cosechas de campos enteros se marchitan, mientras los habitantes de $PROVINCENAME$ se sumergen cada vez más en las nieblas de la adicción.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13070;Rangaku', literally translated as 'Dutch learning', and by extension 'Western learning', is a Japanese word used to describe a particular body of knowledge and learning imported from the west via a Dutch trading station at Dejima. Something similar has ocurred at the trading station in one of our provinces, where local officials are busy translating western books and treatises on science, advancing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ science and understanding of the world.;;Rangaku', wörtlich übersetzt als 'Lehren der Holländer', und weitergehend als 'Lehren aus dem Westen', ist ein japanisches Wort, das ein bestimmtes Wissen bedeutet, welches aus dem Westen über einen holländische Handelsposten in Dejima nach Japan kam. Etwas Ähnliches ist am Handelsposten in $PROVINCENAME$ geschehen, wo örtliche Beamte damit beschäftigt sind, westliche Bücher und wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen zu übersetzen, um die $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Wissenschaft und die Kenntnis von der Welt weiterzubringen.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13080;He hides his face and speaks with controlled anger. A local aristocrat has been insulted by one of the foreigners living in one of our provinces. Apperantly, the foreigner in question failed to bow in the appropriate manner when passing the aristocrat on the street. Shall we tolerate such blatant ignorance of our customs?;;Er verbirgt sein Gesicht und spricht mit kontrolliertem Ärger. Ein lokaler Aristokrat in $PROVINCENAME$ wurde von einem der dort lebenden Ausländer beleidigt. Offensichtlich versäumte der Ausländer, sich in der korrekten Weise zu verbeugen, als er dem Aristokraten auf der Straße begegnete. Sollen wir solch blatante Ignoranz unserer Sitten tolerieren?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13090;He unveils the device with the excitement of a child. - 'You can see their eyes!', he cries, pointing excitedly at the jar of beetles. He instructs you to look into the object -- the glass and metal is cold against your face -- there, in curves of an optic lense, reality is magnified ten times over. - 'It's a microscope!, he laughs. - 'I bought it from one of the foreigners!';;Er enthüllt den Apparat mit der Begeisterung eines Kindes. - 'Man kann ihre Augen sehen!', ruft er aus und deutet aufgeregt auf das Glas mit den Käfern. Er bedeutet Ihnen, in den Apparat zu schauen -- das Glas und Metall fühlt sich auf Ihrem Gesicht kalt an -- dort, in den Biegungen einer optischen Linse, sieht die Realität zehnmal größer aus. - 'Es ist ein Mikroskop!', lacht er. - 'Ich habe es von den Ausländern in $PROVINCENAME$ gekauft!';;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13140;Some intelligence concerning our military preparations has spread from the military mission in one of our provinces, severely hurting our war effort. We have expelled the members of the mission, but the damage has already been done.;Des renseignements confidentiels concernant nos préparatifs militaires ont été divulgués par la mission militaire de $PROVINCENAME$, estropiant gravement notre effort de guerre. Nous avons expulsé les membres de la mission, mais le mal est fait.;Einige Informationen über unsere militärischen Vorbereitungen haben sich aus der Militärmission in $PROVINCENAME$ verbreitet und schaden unseren Kriegsbemühungen enorm. Wir haben die Missionsmitglieder des Landes verwiesen, aber der Schaden ist passiert.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13160;Sailors winding up drunk in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ prisons aren't normally affairs of state, but this is an exception. A navyman from one of the Great Powers has been arrested by officials in one of our cities, after having murdered one of our subjects in what appears to have started as a bar fight. The diplomatic attaché insists that the sailor be handed over to the country in question, and tried according to their laws. This presents us with a conundrum. Granting this privilege once is tantamount to allowing extraterritoriality to all foreign subjects, but not doing so might very well cause international uproar. This issue merits careful consideration.;;Betrunkene Matrosen, die in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Gefängnissen landen, sind üblicherweise keine Staatsaffären, aber dies ist eine Ausnahme. Ein Matrose aus einer der Großmächte wurde in $PROVINCENAME$ verhaftet, nachdem er einen unserer Untertanen im Verlauf einer Kneipenschlägerei umbrachte. Der diplomatische Attaché besteht darauf, dass der Matrose den Gerichten seines Heimatlandes ausgeliefert und dort nach ihren Gesetzen verurteilt wird. Dies bringt uns in eine Zwickmühle. Dieses Privileg ist ein wichtiger Teil der Extraterritorialität, die allen Ausländern zusteht, aber wenn wir es nicht tun, sehen wir einem internationalen Aufschrei entgegen. Dieses Problem muss sorgfältig durchdacht werden.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13185;An Invitation Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13185;A group of western expatriates currently residing in $CAPITAL$ have offered an invitation to high-ranking members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to attend a fancy affair in the legation quarter. We're well aware that this is just an excuse for these men to gain more influence in $COUNTRY$-- but there could be benefits for us as well, namely using the opportunity to gain insight into their methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13186;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13220;Several of the Great Powers have in the past few years sought to establish formalized and permanent embassies in $COUNTRYNAME$, but up until now we've turned down their proposals. However, an idea has been floating around the capital that we should perhaps allow them to set up these embasasies after all, provided they are all kept in one place where we can exact some amount of control over them. Perhaps a Legation Quarter in $CAPITAL$ could be just the thing?;;Mehrere Großmächte haben in der Vergangenheit versucht, formelle und permanente Botschaften in $COUNTRYNAME$ zu errichten, aber bis heute haben wir ihre Ansinnen abgelehnt. Jedoch geistert eine Idee durch die Hauptstadt, dass wir ihnen vielleicht doch erlauben sollten, hier Botschaften zu errichten, solange sie alle am selben Ort sind, wo wir sie bis zu einem gewissen Grad kontrollieren können. Vielleicht wäre ein Legationsviertel in $PROVINCENAME$ genau das Richtige?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13230;Wandering alone in the streets of $CAPITAL$ can be a dangerous thing, as a foreign ambassador in the Legation Quarter recently found out. Guards report having found him dead at 4 a.m. in the morning, apperently the vicitm of a robbery, however the foreigners accuse us of having failed in our supposed responsibility to protect their diplomats. We fear that even a formal apology will not be enough to placate them, however, something more tangible might...;;Alleine durch die Straßen von $PROVINCENAME$ zu wandern, kann gefährlich sein, wie ein ausländischer Botschafter im Legationsviertel neulich herausfand. Wachen fanden ihn um vier Uhr morgens tot auf, offensichtlich Opfer eines Raubüberfalls. Die Ausländer aber beschuldigen uns, unserer angeblichen Pflicht, ihre Diplomaten zu schützen, nicht Genüge getan zu haben. Wir fürchten, dass selbst eine formelle Entschuldigung nicht ausreichen wird, um sie zu besänftigen, aber vielleicht etwas mehr Handfestes ...;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13280;The reforms sweeping through our country have upset the landed elites in one of our cities.;Les réformes menées dans notre pays déplaisent aux élites foncières de $PROVINCENAME$.;Die unser Land überziehenden Reformen haben die Landbesitzereliten in $PROVINCENAME$ verärgert.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13202;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13202;Our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have worsened to the point that members of their government have begun a campaign to reduce or even eliminate $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence. Some of our diplomats have fled, and now we are faced with the unpleasant prospect of either enforcing our interests or suffering embarassment at our inability to manage a former ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13240_NEW;The oil lamp flickered, casting an orange, sooty glow across the moist brown of the cargo hold. The average ship docking in $COUNTRY$ carried very little to raise an eyebrow, but years of being fooled and fooled again by foreign merchants, trying to dodge some excise or other, had left him with a sixth sense for when things were out of order. A rat scurrying between some crates tipped him off. A sweet, pungent scent too familiar not to be alluring. Opium. A cargo hold full of opium.;;Die Öllampe flackerte und schien ein rußig-oranges Glühen über das feuchte Braun des Frachtraums. Das durchschnittlich aussehende Schiff, das in $PROVINCENAME$ vor Anker lag, führte wenig mit sich, das auch nur ein Augenbrauenheben verursachen würde, doch Jahre der Erfahrung mit ausländischen Kaufleuten, die immer wieder versuchten, ihn aufs Kreuz zu legen und Steuern zu umgehen, hatten ihm einen sechsten Sinn dafür eingebracht, wann etwas nicht in Ordnung war. Eine zwischen einigen Kisten umherhuschende Ratte hatte es ihm verraten. Ein süßlicher Geruch, zu vertraut, um nicht verlockend zu wirken. Opium. Ein ganzer Frachtraum voller Opium.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13365;Boxers Occupy Foreign-Held Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13365;The Righteous Society of Harmonious Fists have invaded lands currently owned by a colonial power, but which rightfully belong to the Chinese. More than that, they have successfully occupied the territory and rebuffed efforts by westerners to take it back. We can attempt to stake our claim over the land once again," though if we do it is all but tantamount to a declaration of war-- and, considering the state the Qing Empire is in", it might be a war in which we stand to lose more than we gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13370;The Boxers Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13370;$CAPITAL$ has been occupied by the Righteous Society of Harmonious Fists, who have successfully driven foreign influence out of the country and restored it to its traditional policies of isolationism. What repercussions this will cause with the western powers remains to be seen, but for the moment the Empire stands triumphant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16401;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Applies For Statehood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16401;Yesterday morning we recieved a petition from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, requesting Statehood in the United States of Central America. A state constitution has been submitted, along with maps defining the state's territorial boundries. Common opinion seems to hold it a forgone conclusion that we will accept this petition for statehood and forever join $FROMCOUNTRY$ into our prosperous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16500;Second Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16500;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests. This has led to demands for a second constitutional convention and a change to a more proportional system of government based on population-- a demand adamantly opposed by the south, and not universally supported even in the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16501;Dissatisfaction in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16501;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests. Despite the move to more proportional government, things have not changed and thus there is talk that perhaps it is the north that needs to secede into a new union based on the freedom of men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16505;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. In fact, all over $STATENAME$ there is talk of secession, fueled by outrage over the changes to the American constitution which have stripped states of their equality. Local sentiments seem to be turning towards the south even though $STATENAME$ is not a slave state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16506;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. In fact, all over $STATENAME$ there is talk of secession, as liberals spread loud complaints over their dissatisfaction with the deadlock in the senate. They speak of a new Union based in the north, based on the true freedom the fouding fathers intended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16510;The Free States of America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16510;A convention of northern delegates have convened in Philadelphia to announce the formation of a new union: the Free States of America, free of slavery and dedicated to true freedom for all men. The 'true' American government has decreed this the act of traitors, and already is assembling its military to crush the northern secessionists. The so-called Free American government, however, is calling on patriots to rebel against a government held hostage to southern aristocrats and hidebound thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16515;The Union Sundered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16515;The civil war is over... and we have lost. The United States of America that was is now gone. Delegates in $CAPITAL$ have convened to urge the government to put aside the former constitution, declaring it irrelevant for the reality that now faces us. A new constitution is being drafted, one heralding our place as master of the South, though there are yet some who say our destiny must one day be retaken and that not all is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME17710;Communist Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17710;Communists have been distributing literature among the working classes in one of our states. They are claiming that the common man needs to rise up against the 'bourgeois' class, and that rule by the workers is the only way they can obtain fair conditions and a truly utopian society. Government officials are concerned, and some say that we need to crack down hard on this kind of talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME17715;The Common Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17715;Socialist leanings have become quite prevalent in parts of $COUNTRY$, and among these socialists radical ideas have been spreading-- namely that the common man can only achieve true freedom by overthrowing the government and establishing a rule by the working class. They cite the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as tyrannical, and one that will never bend to true reform... and the people have been listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME17720;Communist Riot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17720;The tense situation in one of our states has been aggravated by the presence of communist agitators, spurring on the working classes to rise up against the government and institute a rule by the workers. We could step in, but that might only provoke a rebellion. Allowing the agitators to continue spreading their propaganda, however, might let them get a stronger foothold in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME17730;Communists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC17730;A communist demonstration in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, with shouts decrying the state of workers in $COUNTRY$, has gained the communists a great deal of attention and sympathy throughout $STATENAME$. Attempting to crack down on these agitators may only cause the demonstrations to turn into violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18210;The Right to Vote;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18210;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed. Passing the bill would no doubt cause problems, but the government seems determined to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18215;Party Loyalty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18215;A group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies. These reforms have made things too lax, they say, and will ultimately lead to the demise of $COUNTRY$. They've succeeded in gathering enough clout to pass a bill strengthening the power of the party whips, and ensuring that the party's influence in the government remains absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18220;The Right to Information;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18220;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press. Many feel that the reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ newspapers to become combative with the government, inciting dissension and making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people harder to control. This control is necessary, they say, if $COUNTRY$ is to remain strong and united. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18225;The Right to Gather;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18225;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated-- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18230;Rights of the Opposition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18230;Members of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected. Political boundaries have been shifted, and in some cases members of the opposition have even been harassed. Now it seems a bill has been put before the government which would entrench a large number of these rules, making them permanent. The government is adamant, saying the rules are needed to keep stability in $COUNTRY$, though the bill will no doubt be incredibly unpopular among the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18501;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Way;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18501;Ours is a nation of equality, where no man is placed above another in importance. Everyone strives for the betterment of all. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a wealthy but criminal industrialist has served not to outrage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, but rather to reinforce their ideals. Today our people walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18505;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ingenuity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18506;Ours is a nation of liberty, where every man is born with the inherent right to seek his own destiny. The possibility of prosperity lies within every man's reach. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the acquittal of a man popularly believed to be innocent has served to reinforce our peoples' ideals. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18507;The Price of Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18507;It has been often said that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are accustomed to freedom-- they strive for it, hold it as the greatest of ideals. So it is that they chafe under the yoke of what they see as the government's tyranny. A recent demonstration in one of our cities threatens to spread throughout the state. With the eyes of the world upon us, however, forcefully putting an end to this act of civil disobedience will no doubt be seen as an attack upon our own citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18510;Military Parade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18510;In the eyes of our soldiers as they parade through the streets, nothing can be seen but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$ and the ideals for which our nation stands. These men, and the description fits them, have been fostered since childhood into rigid and firm belief in our nation, and they would die to defend it. Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18511;Ours is a nation of might, where a man's strength determines his success and everyone knows very well how superior we are to our neighbours. None can hope to compare to $COUNTRY$ on our best day. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the execution of a foreigner believed to have been engaged in criminal activities on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soil has served to reinforce our peoples' beliefs. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18515;Send in the Troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18515;Matters in $COUNTRY$ are getting out of hand. Acts of violence are becoming more commonplace, and some claim that revolution is in the air. Many citizens in $CAPITAL$ are calling on the government to take stronger measures. Sending our army to deal with the violence will, however, only bring the attention of the world upon us. Perhaps this is a time to prove that $COUNTRY$ can deal with its affairs in the way we always have-- with civility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18517;Ours is a nation of order, where peace and civility rule the day. Everyone strives for the common good, and for the progress of our nation as a whole. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a prominent criminal figure who had previously eluded authorities has not outraged the people, but rather has served to reinforce their beliefs. Today the people of $COUNTRY$ walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18521;Brotherhood of Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18521;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: peace, brotherhood and fraternity. Such were the virtues this man believed in, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18525;Liberty Shines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18525;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Such were the virtues in which this man believed, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18530;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18531;A recent dispute with one of our neighbours has had an electrifying effect upon the people of $COUNTRY$: 'How can they be allowed to treat us this way?', they ask. Some are calling for war, while others are satisfied with the knowledge that our nation has already come out on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18535;Onward to Tomorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18535;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: order, industry and productivity. Such were the virtues in which this man believed, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18550;Rejecting Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18550;Our people have attempted to embrace the ideals of westernization for a long time, but now there is a growing movement to return to the traditional $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. It falls to the nation's leaders to set the example: should we embrace the ideal of tradition once again, or should westernization remain our goal despite our continuing isolation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18551;Embracing Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18551;Our people have held to our traditions for a very long time. After many years of exposure to the western nations, however, a growing movement has begun to change the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. Intellectuals in $CAPITAL$ say the government should lead the people into an era of progress and not remain mired in our backward ways. Shall we throw these fools into prison, or consider what they have to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18555;Clash of Ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18555;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have clashed with members of the aristocracy in $CAPITAL$. The aristocracy has accused the intellectual elite of attempting to cast aside the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life, while the intellectuals say that progress is necessary if $COUNTRY$ is to have any chance against western imperialist powers. The argument of the intellectuals is convincing, but this has not calmed matters in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18556;New Ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18556;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have brought several new ideas before the court, ideas that could advance our research considerably. They are also quite contentious, however, and a rejection of the intellectuals could do much to soothe the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18560;Annals of the Past;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18560;The peasants are taking to the streets, rising up against their rulers in ways that would have been unthinkable only decades ago. Perhaps it is time to remind them of their duty to their nation, and of the traditions which have served $COUNTRY$ so well in ages past?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18561;Celebration in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18561;A great celebration has been held in $CAPITAL$ in honor of $COUNTRY$'s rulers, as well as its centuries of honorable tradition. Massive crowds appeared to cheer on our soldiers, and the spectacle has even drawn the attention of foreigners. Shall we dedicate the celebration to $COUNTRY$'s greatness, or shall we instead use it as an excuse to appease the masses?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18562;The Fight Against Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18562;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionaries have begun heated debates in one of our states, arguing that $COUNTRY$ should not be slavishly seeking to chase after 'civilized' nations-- indeed, that already $COUNTRY$ has gone too far down the path of degradation and that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people suffer for it. They are calling on the government to repeal reforms, or at the very least to slow down the rapid pace of change... and they are gaining a wide audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18565;A Return to Western Influence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18565;$COUNTRY$ is a nation of progress, and our current period of insulation against the western powers runs contrary to that ideal. Shall we call on the borders to be opened once again? It might anger some of our people, but the flow of goods and ideas is invaluable to our prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18571;Rejecting the West?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18571;We never wanted this contact with the westerners. They bring too many problems into our country, and their influence spreads like an insidious disease. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court are calling for the borders to be closed once again, for us to display to these imperialists that they cannot simply strut about our nation as if they own it. A display of force is necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19007;Tensions between ourselves and other Great Powers have erupted regarding dominance over the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We are forced into a position where we must either assert our position, which will be seen as undercutting $FROMCOUNTRY$'s independence, or back down and lose much of the influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ we currently hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19365;The Restoration of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19365;An idea has been spreading among the people of $COUNTRY$... some of our lands are under foreign control, but it appears to be beyond our power to regain them on our own. $COUNTRY$ has a great power as its benevolent protector, however, does it not? The people are urging our government to approach them for aid, though some within the government are concerned this could possibly alienate our ally as well, not to mention stir up new hostility with our neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19366;The Restoration of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19366;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, appealing for help in restoring their lost lands. With $COUNTRY_ADJ$, they say, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will prove a much worthier ally. There are those concerned with the trouble this might stir up, however. Should we look the other way, our prove $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence has weight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to consider our proposal. It's possible they will, in the end, take no military action on our behalf… it's come to our attention that relations between them and one of our neighbours has cooled severely, however, so a war may yet come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to intervene on our behalf. Worse, it appears the purpose of our mission has leaked to at least one of our neighbours, angering them greatly bringing threats of war against $COUNTRY$. Did $FROMCOUNTRY$ inform them? Have we been abandoned by our ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19370;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Overlords;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19370;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers marched into $CAPITAL$ today, accompanying the new $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governor who will be overseeing the operation of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ puppet government. Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are up in arms over this imposition by a foreign power, though some are clearly questioning whether there is anything to be done. $COUNTRY$ did not submit willingly, after all, and if a rebellion breaks us free of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would they not simply invade once again? Perhaps $COUNTRY$ has suffered enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31510;A Greater Austrian Destiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31510;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who say Austria's unquestioned dominance obligates it to unite Greater Germany under a single flag. Still others say that, no, Austria already has its own name and empire, one that stretches over many cultures who would never welcome becoming more dominated by the Germans... not to mention that a Greater Germany would alarm the powers of Europe to such a degree it would almost surely herald a war. Thus the question arises: what shall our path be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31511;Limited Autonomy for $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31511;We have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany. There are those within $COUNTRY$ who object, saying that being a German vassal is no better than what we enjoyed previously. But it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31515;The Greater Germany Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers-- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31521;The Dissolution of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more. With Vienna gone and what remains of the Empire a disarray of governments unwilling to maintain their cohesion without an Austrian government to hold it together, the nation has split apart at the seams. Whole portions of the Empire have either declared their outright independence or their intention to reunite with their homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31530;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering such a union could alarm the powers of Europe to a great degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31531;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. While such a nation would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would likely object to such a union. Is Greater Germany worth the possibility of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32509_NEW;the Alaskan Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32509_NEW;We hear word from the Russian ambassador that they are willing to sell their Alaskan colony to us, for the right price. Perhaps we should consider making an offer before someone else snaps it up? The land isn't worth much at the moment, but owning Alaska would be a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32510_NEW;the Alaskan Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32510_NEW;We have received an offer from $FROMCOUNTRY$ to purchase the Alaskan colony. Should we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32512;Intervention in Hungary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32512;The Hungarian revolution in Austria sets a dangerous precedent. There are far too many minorities in $COUNTRY$ who might look to the Hungarians as an inspiration, and who would rise up as well if we do not set a firm example. No matter our relation with the Austrian government, we must consider intervention against the Hungarian rebels or possibly face similar uprisings at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32515;the Treaty of Tartu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32515;Now that Finland is free from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, their government has approached us to engage in territorial talks. They are interested in the northern strip of land known as Petsamo, and the access to the Arctic Ocean it offers, as well as discussing Russian claims to Viipuri. If we give them what they're looking for, $COUNTRY$ looks good in the eyes of the international community and we gain an ally-- but perhaps we do not need Finland as an ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32516;Russia Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32516;Russia has refused to sign the Treaty of Tartu, raising the spectre of war between our nations. Perhaps we should consider surrendering southern Karelia before the Russians come and take it from us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32550;The Belize Purchase?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32550;Central American delegates have recently come in from London in hopes of purchasing British Belize. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32551;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32551;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to sell Belize to us! Long live the United States of Central America!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32552;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32552;$MONARCHTITLE$, negotiations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ over Belize have stalled, and they have declined to sell us the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33006;Trade For Heligoland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33006;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposition: a trade of one of our colonial states in exchange for the island of Heligoland. It's an exorbitant price for such a small island, but the alternative would be to go to war. Shall we agree to the treaty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33007;Germany Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33007;Germany has agreed to the proposed trade for Heligoland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33008;Germany Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33008;Germany has refused the proposed trade for Heligoland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33009;For the Glory of Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33009;The lands of Alsace-Lorraine rightfully belong in the hands of the German people. Perhaps the time has come to reclaim them from the French, and show the world what a united and glorious Germany can achieve? Either that or perhaps we should renounce our claims to those lands once and for all, despite the blow to our prestige and our pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33010;Alsace-Lorraine is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33010;We have failed to recover Alsace-Lorraine from the hated French. Many are suggesting we should renounce our claims and move on, despite the blow to our national pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33020;The League of Three Emperors;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33020;The German Kaiser has sent a delegation to $COUNTRY$ with a proposal: a resurrection of the Holy Alliance formed between Prussia, Austria and Russia which once existed after the defeat of Napoleon. It seems doubtful that such an alliance could bear fruit, but perhaps it is time to consider this idea. $COUNTRY$ has other concerns than constant conflict with the Germans, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33025;The Spanish Pacific;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33025;With the loss of our colonial base in Manila, the administration of the Pacific Islands has become incredibly difficult. We have been approached by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the possibility of selling any of our remaining holdings in the Caroline and Mariana Islands. The amount offered is not much, but then again the islands are not worth much-- indeed, they cost us far more than they provide. There is the additional notion that, should we disagree, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might attempt to take them by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME35305;The Guerra di Libia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC35305;The lands of Tripoli and Cyrenaica once belonged to Italy, and should again. We deserve a place in the sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36215_NEW;Home Rule for Iceland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36215_NEW;The Icelandic Althing has voted to request they be granted home rule, saying the time has come for greater independence. Under their plan, $COUNTRY$ would continue to manage the nation's foreign affairs and defense interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36709;While Belgium's de facto independence from the Netherlands had been established by force of arms during the Belgian Revolution of 1831, it has not been confirmed de jure and we yet hold claims over Belgian territory. The British have offered to mediate a settlement-- in return for the surrendering of our claims and a guarantee of Belgium's neutrality, we would receive the Rhenish part of Luxembourg as our vassal… as well as a great deal of standing in the eyes of the European powers. That is, of course, if Belgium even agrees to the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36710;The Treaty of London;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36710;In a meeting mediated by the British, the Netherlands has offered to sign a treaty which would see them relinquish all claims to Belgian territory-- but at the cost of surrendering Luxembourg to them as a vassal. Some are claiming this is too high a price, and that we should not allow ourselves to be bullied into such a treaty... but this may also be the only chance we have at peace with the Dutch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36711;Belgium Has Signed the Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36711;The Belgian government has agreed to the terms of the Treaty of London. We have surrendered all claims to their territory, in return for control over Luxembourg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36712;Belgium Has Refused the Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36712;The Belgian government has refuse the terms of the Treaty of London. This is a foolish move that only opens up the possibility of more war, but it seems the Belgians will not be moved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36715;The Fall of Amsterdam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36715;Despite our best efforts, the unthinkable has happened: Amsterdam has fallen. It seems there is little choice but to surrender to the Belgians and allow them to dictate terms. If they are kind, they will simply force us to relinquish all claims to the southern Netherlands. If they are unkind, they may force us to give up territory-- though doing so will surely bring about the wrath of the European powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36716;The Dutch Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36716;Our forces have consolidated their control over Amsterdam and proven their superiority in the war, and thus the Dutch government has little choice but to accept any terms we dictate. The European powers are pushing for peace and conciliation -- they wish to see that Belgium keeps what it has and nothing more -- though if we dare risk their wrath we could certainly wrest territorial considerations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36950;The Danish Gold Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36950;The Danish Gold Coast exists on the coast of the Ashanti Union, primarily the fortress of Chistiansborg near the city of Accra. The Danish are willing to sell their holdings to us, though that is likely to result in conflict with the Ashanti government-- who will see the move as encroachment of their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36955;Conflict with Burma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36955;A British Commodore who was recently dispatched to Burma to negotiate several matters regarding the Treaty of Yandabo, signed in 1826 after the First Anglo-Burmese War, has initiated a naval confrontation with the Burmese under questionable circumstances. While many are calling this Commodore an 'irrational jingoist', the British cannot let this matter drop without losing a great deal of prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36960;The Gold Coast Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36960;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with the hopes of negotiating a treaty. They want to solidify control over the Gold Coast in Africa, specifically by annexing our colony at Sekondi. In return, they will recognize our colonial holdings elsewhere and encourage greater cooperation between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36965;The Lagos Slave Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36965;We outlawed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ slave trade many years ago, but it continues in many African nations-- and the coastal city of Lagos in particular. Lagos has been a haven for slavers, providing unwilling natives to the trade on markets in defiance of all decent conventions. The notion has arisen that we should consider sending our ships in to liberate the natives there and establish a colony where they can receive civilized government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36966;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Seizes Lagos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36966;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ships have sailed into Lagos, seizing the city and driving off the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison. They claim they are 'liberating' the city from slavers, extending their benevolent rule on behalf of the locals. Resisting means war, but submitting would do nothing more than prove our lack of ability to face these foreigners. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36970;The Suez Canal Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36970;With the 'International Commission for the Piercing of the Isthmus of Suez' having completed, and assessed the Suez region as being possible to have a canal built," all that remains is to put the plan in motion. The Suez Canal Company intends to do just that, but in order for it to start it needs to put together a significant amount of capital-- thus it has been offering shares to various governments", hoping as well for the political clout to influence Egypt into allowing the venture to proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36975;Intervention in Egypt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36975;We have received disturbing reports of rebellion in Egypt, on a scale where our interests in the Suez might become threatened. While it undoubtedly would appear to some that we are using this as an excuse, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government cannot idly stand by and watch such an important project be laid to waste by the ignorant. We must consider direct intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37219_NEW;Persecution of French Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37219_NEW;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In Dai Nam, the execution of several missionaries has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. This has gone nowhere, leaving us with little choice but to consider armed intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37230;The Kingdom of Pomare;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37230;The island of Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean, ruled by the primitive Queen Pomare IV," expelled two French catholic priests several years ago. Admiral Abel Aubert Dupetit-Thouars was dispatched to get reparations for the deed, but then proceeded-- without authorization-- to gain a request from the Queen's chiefs to request a protectorate", a treaty to which he then demanded the Queen acquiesce. We can approve the treaty, gaining use of Tahiti as a staging ground in the Pacific, but it may cause friction with the British Empire considering British colonists are also on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37710;Carlism Prevails;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37710;A new line of the Bourbon family has been established on the Spanish throne, descending from the Infante Carlos. To many traditionalists, this signals a rebirth of the true Spanish Empire. Others are not so optimistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37711;The First Carlist War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37711;The death of King Ferdinand in 1833 and the ascension of young Isabela (only three years old at the time) to the throne of Spain sparked a revolt by supporters of the King's brother, the Infante Carlos. He intends to depose Isabela and establish a separate branch of the Bourbon family, as well as restore the Spanish Empire to its traditional glory-- something liberals say simply cannot be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37712;The Carlists Defeated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37712;The Carlists have been routed and peace has been restored to Spain-- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37713;Return of the Carlists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37713;We thought the supporters of the Infante Carlos and his descendants had been completely routed, yet once again there are reports of a cell having been established in one of our provinces. Supporters of the current pretender are busy drumming up recruits and calling for the overthrow of the Spanish government. Rooting them out will not be easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37714;Carlist Sympathies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37714;It seems that sympathies for the Carlists among the locals in $PROVINCENAME$ have been increasing. Reports have it that another rebel cell has been established, and that a campaign of resistance against Spanish authorities has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37715;Carlist Cell Discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37715;The Carlist cell in $PROVINCENAME$ has been found! After a battle with authorities, the majority of the rebels have been either captured or executed. We have found good information in their base, including the names of many of their supporters throughout $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37716;The Christinos Prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37716;The capital has been overrun, the pretender king driven into the provinces, and the original royal line descending from Ferdinand VII has been restored to the Spanish throne. Many liberals are breathing a sigh of relief, but reactionaries are furious. Already supporters of the pretender are seeking new allies in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37717;Rise of the Christinos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37717;The supporters of the former royal line still exist, and we have begun to receive reports of a Christino cell having been established in one of our provinces. They are gaining a great deal of support among liberals in the province with their calls for an overthrow of the 'pretender' on the throne. The cell is well-hidden, and rooting them out will not be easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37718;Christino Sympathies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37718;It seems that sympathies for the Christinos among the locals in $PROVINCENAME$ have been increasing. Reports have it that another rebel cell has been established, and that a campaign of resistance against Spanish authorities has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37719;Christino Cell Discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37719;The Christino cell in $PROVINCENAME$ has been found! After a battle with authorities, the majority of the rebels have been either captured or executed. We have found good information in their base, including the names of many of their supporters throughout $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37720;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37720;The death of Leopoldo O'Donnell has eroded Queen Isabella's support, to the point where a movement to overthrow her has rapidly developed. A mutiny by naval officers in Cadiz has provided the spark for a widespread revolt against Isabella's rule. Her chief minister and generals have deserted her, and Isabella was forced to flee into exile. For the moment, Spain stands without a ruler, and the provisional government argues over what its next step should be. Some favor abandoning the monarchy altogether, but most feel a new king should be selected. Isabella's heir, Prince Alfonso, is thought by many to be too much under her influence. Other choices are the moderate Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern and the liberal Prince Amadeo of Savoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37721;The Spanish Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37721;With Queen Isabella II having been deposed by a revolt, the Spanish provisional government has been busy seeking a new monarch to assume the throne... and among the candidates considered was Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern. Our government objected strongly to the move, as this would spread Prussian influence to our southern border, and while this did convince Prince Leopold to turn down the throne it has not endeared us to the Prussians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37722;King Leopold of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37722;With Queen Isabella II having been deposed by a revolt, the Spanish provisional government has been busy seeking a new monarch... and the candidate they have chosen is none other than Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern. A German prince on the Spanish throne is a direct threat to our nation's security. We must do something about this immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37725;King Leopold Assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37725;The Hohenzollern king of Spain, controversial since his ascension to the throne and constantly balked in the royal courts by moarchists advocating a return to the Bourbon line, was shot dead in his carriage shortly after arriving in Madrid following a country outing. The country is left in chaos and once again without a monarch on the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37730;The Abdication of Amadeo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37730;King Amadeo, controversial since his ascension and constantly balked in the royal courts by moarchists advocating a return to the Bourbon line, has angrily declared Spain to be 'ungovernable' after the Hidalgo Affair forced him into conflict with the nation's military and has abdicated the throne. The country is left in chaos and once again without a monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37735;A Return to Bourbon Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37735;The Spanish Republic has been contentious since its inception. After a series of failed governments, many Spaniards have come to favor a return to the stability of Bourbon rule. In a coup led by Brigadier General Martinez Campos, the Republican army has declared its alliegiance to Prince Alfonso-- son of the exiled Queen Isabella II-- and named him King of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37740;The Treaty of Paris, $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37740;We are losing the war with $FROMCOUNTRY$, and it's only a matter of time before we're forced to submit to a humiliating defeat. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has made it clear it considers our colonial holdings to be beyond our ability to control, and is willing to purchase them for a 'fair' price. Failure to submit to their demands will mean the war dragging on to its inevitable conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has signed the Treaty of Paris. Their colonial holdings are ours, for a price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37742;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37742;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sign the Treaty of Paris. The war continues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37743;Carlist Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37743;The Carlists have been spreading their propaganda into neighboring $PROVINCENAME$, and reports have it that their lies are finding a ready audience among the locals. We can put a stop to their efforts, though not without being rather indiscriminate in our arrests and reprisals among $PROVINCENAME$'s poor. Still, radical measures may be called for in order to stop the Carlists from gaining headway here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37744;Christino Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37744;The Christinos have been spreading their propaganda into neighboring $PROVINCENAME$, and reports have it that their lies are finding a ready audience among the locals.

Still, radical measures may be called for in order to stop the Christinos from gaining headway here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37745;Moroccan Border Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37745;A heated dispute has arisen between the Moroccans and our government over the boundaries of our holdings in Melilla. Some believe the Moroccans are attempting to gain sympathy from the French, but we have it on good authority that there will be no aid coming for them. Now may be the time for us to exert some of our authority over this African upstart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37750;We have lost the war with the Americans,and Cuba has been wrested from our grasp. The American government has approached us intent on a treaty, suggesting we no longer have the power to hold onto our Pacific and North American colonies. They seek to offer us a 'reasonable' price for them. Some in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ govrnment fear that, if we do not agree, it could mean further wars with the Americans for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37751;We Have Lost The War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37751;As impossible as it seems, we have lost the war against the Spanish. They retain their hold over Cuba and their other colonies. The American people are understandably shaken, but it seems their jingoistic fervor has only increased. A streak of anti-colonialism has arisen throughout the country, specifically targeting the powers of 'Old Europe'. Newspapers are demanding we gear up to liberate these colonies once and for all. If we agree, some fear this may be a tiger we cannot again cage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME38505;Death of the Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC38505;The death of Sa'id bin Sultan Al-Busaid has left him with two sons, each of which has claimed Oman as their own to rule. The result of this struggle has brought in foreign mediation, with the resulting decree that the nation will be split into two sultanates: one in Zanzibar and one in Muscat, each ruled by one of Al-Basaid's sons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44122;Webster–Ashburton Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44122;We have concluded a treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, resolving several long-standing border disputes between our nations. In particular, the treaty has clearly established the border between Maine and the British colony of New Brunswick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44125;The Western Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44125;Mexico is not properly utilizing the lands between ours and the Pacific. It is our destiny to bring American rule and prosperity to all of North America, and our responsibility to take these lands from Mexico so they may flourish. To avoid further war with Mexico, we should approach their government and see if they will consider selling these lands to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44126;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Northwest Territories!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44126;The American ambassador has informed us that it would be in our best interests to sell the lands north of the Rio Grande to the United States. The amount they offer is considerable, and the northwest territories are of limited value to us, but it is almost an insult that they would think us so eager to give up our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44127;Mexico Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44127;The Mexicans have refused our generous offer. Our only recourse is force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44140;The Northern Alaska Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44140;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to inquire about the possibility of purchasing our territory in northern Alaska. The land is not valuable, and since previous $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ claims to the area will no doubt only lead to conflict, we should perhaps consider the sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44141;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44141;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sell the Alaskan territory. Considering that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people already consider the territory rightfully ours, many are calling for war to reclaim the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44142;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44142;The Alaskan territory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44145;The Hawaiian Islands Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44145;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to inquire about the possibility of purchasing our Pacific Island territories near Hawaii. The land is not valuable, and previous $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ claims to the area will no doubt only lead to conflict. We should perhaps consider the sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44146;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sell the Hawaiian Islands territory. Considering the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people already consider the territory rightfully ours, many are calling for war to reclaim the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44150;54-40 or Fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44150;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Oregon Country. The entire region west of the Rockies (called Columbia by the British) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. The British claim all the way south to the 42nd Parallel and the Americans north to the 54th Parallel. It's clearly a tense situation, and the specter of war with the British looms as politicians in the current election campaign are banging the drums of Manifest Destiny in order to gain support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44151;The Columbia District;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44151;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. The British claim all the way south to the 42nd Parallel and the Americans north to the 54th Parallel. The situation is tense, and made more so by jingoistic American politicians calling for sovereignty over the entire continent. Even so, the American government has sent a delegation seeking a compromise in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44153;Oregon Negotiations Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44153;The talks with the British have broken down, primarily due to the continuing calls by war-mongering politicians. Neither of our options now is very pleasant: either we abandon our claims to Oregon no matter what some might think, or we press ahead with the claims and brace for eventual war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44154;American Claims in Columbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44154;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. Recently the situation has been exacerbated by American politicians rattling their sabers over their idea of 'Manifest Destiny', and they have pressed their claim all the way north to the 54th Parallel. It will almost certainly mean war, and our only consideration should probably be whether we wish to pursue another costly war with the Americans in North America when our time could better be spent elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44155;Oregon Country is Ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44155;The British have elected to withdraw from Oregon and have signed a treaty to hand any American land over to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44303;Pacification of the Metis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44303;It has taken time to settle the grievances following the Riel Rebellion, but treaties with the various Metis groups throughout the North-West territories have managed to properly incorporate them into Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44305;Rebellions of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44305;Perhaps inspired by the American Revolution, colonists in both the Lower Canada and Upper Canada colonies have risen up in rebellion. They are frustrated by the lack of political reform, as well as the entrenched power held by the reactionary elites of the 'Family Compact', and agitators are demanding responsible government if not outright independence. The colonial government has moved to arrest the perpetrators as traitors to the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44306;Lord Durham's Report;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44306;Lord Durham has returned from his mission to investigate the causes of the rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada with recommendations to the British crown-- namely that the two colonies be united under a single responsible government through an Act of Union. He fears that, if we do not, we may be facing further rebellion just as was faced in America. Indeed, it is entirely possible the Canadian radicals could attract support from the Americans if they are not appeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44310;The Charlottetown Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44310;A gathering of governors from our Maritime colonies in North America has also been attended by governors from Canada. According to reports, they are attempting to organize a larger confederation of the colonies with an eye towards eventual self-government. We would like to see the North American colonies be more self-reliant, so it may be in our best interest to allow this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44315;The Canadian Dominion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44315;The colonial government of Canada has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see renewed rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44316;The Dominion of Quebec;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44316;The colonial government of Quebec has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see renewed rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44317;The Maritime Dominion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44317;The colonial governments of the Maritimes have officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colonies better able to protect themselves without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44318;The Dominion of British Columbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44318;The colonial government of British Columbia has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44322;The Rupert's Land Act Fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44322;A British act which would have seen us offered the rights to purchase all of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company has been defeated. Canadian dreams of uniting the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific have been dashed in one fell swoop! Citizens in $CAPITAL$ are outraged at this betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44325;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Asks To Join Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44325;Relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ are friendly, and thus the dream of a larger Canadian confederation has resurfaced. Delegates from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made the journey to $CAPITAL$ with the goal of negotiating terms of joining our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44339;The Northwest Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44339;The land north of the 60th parallel is inhospitable to settlers, but there is a growing concern that should the Canadian government not move to fully claim the territory another power will do so. It will take considerable political capital to convince the other world powers of Canadian dominion in the north, but many feel we must make the effort... and considering there are reports of gold in the Yukon it might be wise to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44351;The British Columbian Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44351;Representatives from British Columbia have met with Canadian delegates in $CAPITAL$ to discuss terms of their joining confederation. The only thing that appears to interest them is the building of a national railway linking the Pacific and the Atlantic. Without it, they say, the nation is too divided and they are more connected with other regions along the Pacific coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44355;First Stage of the CNR;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44355;The first stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Winnipeg to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the second stage, which will be considerably more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44356;Second Stage of the CNR;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44356;The second stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Calgary to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the last stage, which will be the longest and most difficult yet as it requires creating a pass through the Rocky Mountains themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44357;The CNR Completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44357;After a massive effort expended to create a pass through the Rocky Mountains, the Canadian National Railway has been completed! A single railway now links the Pacific coast to the Atlantic. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate the first locomotive being sent to make the complete journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44805;Antonio López de Santa Anna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44805;A general and war hero of Mexican independence, Santa Anna was elected President in 1833. After deposing his liberal vice-president, Santa Anna abrogated the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with both church and military backing. Many Mexican states objected to this centralization of power, and with the rebellion of Tejas to the north the entire country seems to be in a state of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44810;Rebellion in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44810;Malcontents in $STATENAME$ have risen up in defiance of the government, demanding a return to democratic rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44815;Texas Recaptured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44815;The rebel state of Tejas has been recaptured. A glorious victory for Mexico, and a blow against the malcontents who seek to spread dissension and discord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44820;Republic of the Rio Grande;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44820;Inspired by the success of the Tejas rebellion, liberal malcontents in the provinces along the Rio Grande have risen up and declared their independence from Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44821;The Yucatan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44821;Angered by the abrogation of the 1824 Constitution and the centralization of government power in Mexico City, liberals in the Yucatan have declared their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44822;Join the United Provinces?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44822;Eventually, the Mexican government will come after our country and seek to re-incorporate it into the federation. If we are to survive, joining the United Provinces of Central America may be our only hope. Shall we make the request?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44825;The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44825;With our capital under American control, it seems we have little choice but to negotiate. The Americans have offered us a deal: the normalization of relations, the forgiveness of our debt and the payment of a great deal of money... all in exchange for a cession of all the northern territories currently claimed by their country. If we refuse, it may mean many years more of war for us until these Americans get what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ceding all American-claimed territory to our control. For now, the relations between our two countries can return to normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44827;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44827;Despite having them over the figurative barrel, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused to capitulate to our demands. So much the worse for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44830;Execution of Emperor Maximilian;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44830;Emperor Maximilian has never enjoyed popular support in Mexico, and now that insurgents led by Benito Juárez have captured him it seems his reign has come to an end. Court-martialed and executed by a firing squad, the new republic was declared only days after his death. Benito Juárez has assumed the role of President of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44835;The Plan of Tuxtepec;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44835;Porfirio Díaz, General of Mexico and considered a hero by some, has overthrown the democratic government of Mexico in a military coup. Planned in secret with several military officers and announced in Oaxaca, it has disavowed the presidency of Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada and installed Diaz as a military-backed dictator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44840;Santa Anna Captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44840;In a surprise development, the leader of Mexico -- General Antonio de Santa Anna himself -- has been captured. Found running through the countryside, attempting to escape back to Mexico, he has been imprisoned in a Texan jail and forced to negotiate. We can force the man to agree to a peace treaty -- even though many consider the odds of Santa Anna's own country agreeing to terms exacted under duress to be slight, it may be our only hope against overwhelming odds. At the very least, the humiliation dealt against their leader will be a blow against the Mexican government and one from which they will not soon recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44841;In a humiliating blow to Mexico's prestige, General Santa Anna has been captured within Texan territory-- separated from our army and found wandering the countryside in an attempt to return to Mexico. While imprisoned, he agreed to a series of treaties which recognized Texan independence among other guarantees... all in exchange for his safe return. We are now faced with a question: while the treaties are worthless, disregarding them completely could give the Americans a cause to intervene. Either way, one thing is certain: as the architect of this fiasco, Santa Anna's time in power is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44842;The Treaties of Velasco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44842;While Mexico had every reason to refute the treaties signed by Santa Anna, it seems their willingness to continue the war against Texas has waned. They will not embarass themselves further, and have agreed to let us remain free in exchange for Santa Anna's return. For the moment, this means the war with Mexico is over... whether that peace will continue remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44843;Ceasefire With Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44843;As expected, the Mexican government has refuted the Treaties of Velasco and refused to negotiate for Santa Anna's return. They are, however, evidently afraid that the treaties have enough validity that ignoring them would give the Americans an excuse to intervene-- and have called for a ceasefire. How long it will last is unknown, but for the moment Texas has its respite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44844;Mexico Ignores the Treaties;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44808;Not unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco-- claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44845;War With Mexico!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44845;Despite the assurances supposedly offered by the Treaties of Velasco, we once again find ourselves at war with Mexico. The ceasefire is, it seems, now over. While many in our government never expected Mexico to live up to the terms of the treaties anyhow, they do suggest that this might be enough cause for the Americans to intervene. Such an intervention would, of course, be inviting the wolves through the front door… but do we have any other choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44846;The Texan Diplomat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44846;A diplomat has arrived in Washington from Texas-- a part of the Mexican frontier, settled by southerners who had been offered land by the Mexican government and who then rebelled against its tyranny. The diplomat has asked for American intervention in their war, claiming that a treaty had been worked out with Mexico which they then of course immediately refuted. It seems like shaky grounds… but do we turn our backs on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME45102;La Trinitaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC45102;Juan Pablo Duarte has founded a secret society called 'La Trinitaria', seeking complete independence of Santo Domingo from Haiti and other foreign powers. Many Caribenos are calling the man a visionary, and his ideas are gaining great popularity in eastern Hispaniola.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46303;War of the Farrapos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46303;Porto Alegre is under Brazilian control once again. The gauchos, however, have promised to continue their rebellion against what they consider unfair rule from the throne. It may prove difficult in the coming years to keep the region calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46304;Solano's Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46304;The dictator of Paraguay, Solano Lopez, has turned his eye towards Brazilian lands to the southeast. Direct access to the Atlantic Ocean would be of great benefit to the country, rather than relying on Uruguayan permission to use the river-- permission which might not always be forthcoming, thanks to Brazilian interference. Perhaps it is time to flex Paraguay's muscle and establish an empire of our own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46605;The Argentine Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46610;The Constitutional Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46610;General Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has turned against the Rosas government and demanded that it submit to liberal demands for a new constitution. There are hints that neighboring governments might support Urquiza, and that should he rise up in rebellion against us they will intervene on his behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46611;The Argentine Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46611;With Rosas unable to defeat the Entre Rios rebellion, he has been forced to flee Argentina and General Urquiza has assumed temporary control of the government. Meeting with liberals in Santa Fe, they have drawn up a new constitution which has created an Argentine Republic. The Buenos Aires province is displeased and vows to resist,but the wind of change is clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46612;General Urquiza Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46612;The rebellion in Entre Rios has been put down, and both General Urquiza and his liberal supporters have been captured and executed. The Argentine states have submitted to the will of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49501;Reforming the Kalmar Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49501;Members of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government have approached us, suggesting that the Kalmar Union must be ressurrected. For the moment, this is simply an idea, a suggestion that the Scandinavian nations should work together towards an eventual union. If we disagree, it's possible that the idea dies here. If we don't, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might be mortally insulted. If Scandinavians are to take their rightful place in Europe, however, perhaps there is merit in their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA49501;A royal marriage cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB49501;We see little reason to join such a union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ proposal. It is now in our hands whether to let the Union die here and now, or force $FROMCOUNTRY$  to join us whether they like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA49502;Oh well, I guess that's over then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB49502;We'll see how they feel with an army in their capital...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49503;Form a Customs Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49503;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed the next logical step in our mutual cooperation: a customs union between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$, indeed all of Scandinavia, which would remove the restrictions on trade between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA49503;A customs union cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB49503;This is going too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49504;Form a Political Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has suggested a political union between their country and $COUNTRY$, arguing that this is the next logical step for Scandinavia's security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA49504;It seems like a logical argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB49504;This is going too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49505;Norway Asks For Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49505;Your Norwegian subjects seek to establish their own independent kingdom. The other European powers support their independence, and will be upset if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49506;Norway Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49506;This time they are not asking nicely. Independence or war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49507;Finnish Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49507;Your Finnish subjects seek to form their own nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49508;Danish Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49508;Your Danish subjects wish to end our union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49509;The Leadership of Kalmar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49509;As our power in Scandinavia wanes and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence grows, so does the focus of the union move to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49510;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49510;Our subjects in Finland have become restless, and resistance against attempts of Russification have been growing. Many within the Russian government believe that a restoration of the Diet of Finland and limited self-government for their nation is the only answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC60140;With the new government firmly in control of our country, they feel that now is the time for a constitutional convention. Everyone's views, well at least everyone who truly matters, will be represented in this new gathering to shape the path of our nation.;Alors que les libéraux tiennent les rênes de notre pays, ils estiment le moment venu pour une convention constitutionnelle. Les vues de chacun, du moins de tous ceux qui importent vraiment, seront représentées dans cette nouvelle assemblée afin de forger la voie de nos nations.;Die Liberalen haben unser Land fest im Griff, und sie glauben, dass es jetzt an der Zeit für eine konstitutionelle Verfassung ist. In dieser neuen Verfassung, die den zukünftigen Weg unserer Nation eben wird, werden die Meinungen aller repräsentiert sein, zumindest jener, auf deren Meinung es wirklich ankommt.;;Los liberales, con un firme control sobre el país, creen que ha llegado el momento de organizar una convención constitucional. Todo el mundo (al menos todo el mundo que cuenta) estará representado en esta gran asamblea que dará forma al futuro de nuestro país.;;;;;;;;x  ;
EVTNAME60160;Birth of a Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC60160; Today crowds gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate $COUNTRY$'s independence. In the modern world, independence can be a fleeting thing-- so we must enjoy it while we can. Today, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags wave from every window and corner, and jubilant citizens sing the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ anthem. It is a heartfelt theme that speaks of better tomorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80103;The Amban's Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80103;The Amban, our Imperial representative from Peking and effectively the governor of $COUNTRY$, has informed our government that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has concluded a treaty with Russia-- a treaty that includes portions of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory, with now must be handed over without comment. Should we refuse, we face war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and Russia both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80110;The Convention of Peking;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80110;A diplomat from Russia has arrived in $COUNTRY$ with an infuriating demand: they wish to readjust the borders on our northeastern frontier, agreed upon almost two hundred years ago. They wish access to a southern port upon the Sea of Japan, meaning all of Haishenwai would be turned over to them. Any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$-claimed territory would be handed over by us and our vassals. This is surely a wicked threat, capitalizing on our current perceived weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80111;The Dungan Basin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80111;Now that the rebellion in distant Xinjiang is finished, there appears to be some question as to who has ownership over the Dungan basin. The western half of the basin, in Qaratal, is occupied by the wicked Russians… but they wish control over the eastern half in Ili, as well. Should we surrender the basin peacefully, or fight for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ honor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80115;The Russian Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80115;$COUNTRY$ is a nation hovering between two powers that could crush us without thought. A Russian diplomat has arrived in $CAPITAL$, offering us protection in return for our fealty. Considering the alternative is possible invasion by the Chinese, some think we should consider it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80120;Hui Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80120;Though tolerant of religious practices, the Hui Muslims in $PROVINCENAME$ are resentful of discrimination by the Qing government. Unrest in the province has stirred up anti-Manchu sentiment, even among non-Muslims. The violence is threatening to spread throughout all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80121;Panthay Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80121;Have Peace with Han Chinese!\nDown with Qing court!\n\nA rebellion has erupted in the southern province of Yunnan, led by a rebel named Du Wenxiu. The man's forces have already captured Dali and driven out the Qing governor, forcing our government to deal with the matter directly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80122;Panthay Rebellion Crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80122;With Qing forces marching into Kunming, the Panthay Rebellion is officially over. The rebels and their leaders have been routed, and already measures are being taken to ensure there are no further disturbances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80123;Panthay Rebellion Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80123;We have driven the hated Manchu from Yunnan. At last, victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80125;Dungan Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80125;With Muslim-led unrest existing throughout the province on Xinjiang, a Tajik adeventurer by the name of Yaqub Beg has led rebels to seize the capital of Kashgar and has driven Qing governors away. The situation in the frontier appears to be out of hand, with these Muslims having declared an independent state and full Jihad against the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80126;Dungan Revolt Crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80126;With Qing forces marching into Kashgar, the Dungan Revolt is officially over. The rebels and their leaders have been routed, and already measures are being taken to ensure there are no further disturbances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80127;Dungan Revolt Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80127;We have driven the hated Manchu from Kashgaria. At last, victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85000;Catholics Slain in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85000;There has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux-- head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church-- and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qing Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessal which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea-- but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85001;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Retribution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries-- and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favor with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85002;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85002;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-- which should have brought our Qing allies to our defense. Frustratingly, and perhaps not unexpectedly, the Qing have responded by severing their ties to $COUNTRY$ and abandoning us to our fate. War with the French seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85003;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85003;Not unexpectedly, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to abandon Korea to its fate in order to curry favor with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85004;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Will Defend $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85004;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-- which has brought our Qing allies to bear. Instead of abandoning us, they have threatened war with the French should they intrude on our sovereignty. This may mean war with the French, but at least we know our allies remain strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85005;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Will Defend Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85005;Negotiations with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have not gone well. They are determined to protect their Korean vassals, even if it means war with France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85010;The Ganghwa Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85010;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal Korean fortress. In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home-- but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85011;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, their ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle our forces on land. They returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to demand compensation-- in the form of an unequal treaty requiring $COUNTRY$ be opened to their influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85012;A Japanese vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy. In a fury, the Japanese ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle Korean forces on land. The Japanese returned home victorious, but words of the assault has spread and now we hear tale that they have forced the Koreans to sign an unequal treaty in consequence... one which has forced them to sever tributary ties to $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85015;Korean Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85015;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of Japanese armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated Japanese terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85020;Tonghak Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85020;With increasing frustration against government corruption and foreign influence in $COUNTRY$, a rebel movement has appeared among followers of the Tonghak or 'Eastern Learning' ideology. They have been stirring up the peasant classes, forming poorly-armed if numerous armies to purge the capital and rid the country of Japanese and other foreign presence. We will need to move quickly if we wish to prevent them from overthrowing the government or causing an incident with neighbouring powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85021;Tonghak Rebellion Ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85021;The unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored-- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea-- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85026;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Intervenes in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese-- despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85027;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Forces Enter Seoul;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85027;Reacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. Pro-Japanese supporters have been installed in the new government, effectively rendering us a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal. Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85028;Responding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85029;Chinese Intervene in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85029;Reacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea-- entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called 'help' from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act-- some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90016;Archduke Ferdinand Assassinated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90016;One of the most prominent members of Austrian aristocracy has been murdered by a Serbian assassin, a member of a group of nationalists who seek to rejoin with the Serbian nation. There are definite suspicions that the Serbian government has been secretly helping these nationalists and is behind the event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90017;The Hungarian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90017;With the recent unrest in Hungarian lands, the local Hungarian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90018;The Lombardy Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME90025;Tunisian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90025;It has become increasingly obvious that the Tunisian government operates independently from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. We cannot continue to control them directly, and must either take measures to assert our dominance or allow them to seek their own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90029;Bulgarian Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90029;With the recent unrest in Bulgarian lands, the local Bulgarian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC90034;The time has come to unite with our Greek brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90038;The Pact of Plombières;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90038;We have been approached by a Sardinian envoy, the Count of Cavour, who has made an interesting proposal: an alliance to make war against Austria, gaining Sardinia the Austrian-held provinces of Lombardy. In exchange, Sardinia would hand over Savoy and Nice to France. It is an interesting idea, and one that allows France to take a role that would not paint us as the aggressors. Shall we agree?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90040;The Sepoy Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90040;A mutiny by a group of sepoys in the service of the British East India company has ignited lingering resentment amongst our Indian subjects into open resistance against our rule. Should this grow out of hand, all of our holdings in British India could be in jeopardy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90041;Galician Slaughter;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90041;Polish peasants in Austrian-held Galicia have risen up and slaughtered wealthy landowners, leading to calls by nobility within the Free City of Krakow for a larger uprising. Many in Austria are seeing this as a reason to end Krakow's independence once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90050;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90051;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move. They believe their future lies with the German Confederation to the south, but the Duke of Augustenberg has a stronger claim to Schleswig than the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ King. Schleswig-Holstein must forge its own path, even if it means war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90052;Schleswig-Holstein Under Our Control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90052;Now that order has been restored to Schleswig-Holstein, international pressure is mounting to uphold treaties regarding the region. Failure to restore nominal independence to the duchies and keep them united will result in tensions between $COUNTRY$ and other European powers, and possibly war with the German Confederation to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90053;The November Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support. If the new consitution is signed, Schleswig-Holstein will be officially divided. If it is not, the Danish people will almost certainly rise up against their new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90054;The Schleswig-Holstein Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90054;The arrogant German aristocrats in Holstein have declared they intend to pursue a future with the German Confederation to the south, and consider Schleswig an indivisible part of their territory. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ militants are angrily calling for the military to step in, though some fear this may lead to war with the Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90055;The question of Schleswig-Holstein's place within the German Confederation has now finally been resolved-- in our favor. This will have larger repercussions, as the free German states will see that $COUNTRY$ is the true leader of the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90056;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. This puts it in a unique position to assume leadership of the German Confederation as well as dominance over the North German states. We will need to take swift and decisive action if $COUNTRY$ is to maintain its position of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90057;Look to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90057;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. It's possible that aligning ourselves with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is far more in our best interest, as well as more likely to create a united Germany under North German dominance. We should reconsider our current allegiances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90060;The Eastern Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire's hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90061;Planning for the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90062;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90062;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of $COUNTRY$ to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to carve up our nation, and an insult, but regardless we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90063;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90063;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to bolster the shaky Empire's hold over the Middle East and balk Russian 'aggression'. Either way, we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90064;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90064;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them. Still others feel we should not take part in this veiled attempt at dismembering a sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90065;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Keep the Empire Strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favored the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress's edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90066;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Stabilize the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90067;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90068;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consesus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defies the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decreed that it will not abide by the demands of the Congress. The Treaty, they say, is so much worthless paper, and they refuse to give up any of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90075;The Fate of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90077;Negotiations with the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90078;Egypt Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine-- something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90079;Egypt Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90080;The Egyptian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90081;Egypt Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90081;We have brought Egypt to its knees and restored Ottoman rule to the area. Now we must decide whether to be gracious and allow them to retain autonomy, while restricting their land and power, or whether to rule all of Egypt directly and face the possibility of rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90082;Rebellion Against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082;An uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ has gained popularity throughout the region, spreading the unrest throughout all of $STATENAME$. Local authorities have moved swiftly in an attempt to keep the violence contained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90083;Anger Over Egyptian Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90083;Still stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms, and there are fears that if they are not satisified they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90084;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair-- instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal... $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90085;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90086;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90086;We have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90087;The Fall of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90088;The Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control. Our advisors say that wresting control of the entire country is almost impossible, and that we should take the offer while we can and let the Egyptians go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90089;End of the Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now. All that remains is for us to decide whether to end hostilities with the Egyptians and return any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lands that we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90090;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90091;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90091;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If something isn't done it could develop into an alliance between Egypt and $FROMCOUNTRY$ that could lead to their intervention in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90092;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90092;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If we do not object now, that support could lead to their intervention in the war. That objection, however, could also be seen as aggression on our part and harm our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90093;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Withdrawal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90094;Egypt has fallen, settling matters with the Turks through a peace treaty which has seen the Levant taken from them and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Egypt vastly reduced. We can let the matter lie, or fight for both our stake in Egypt and our honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95095;Norwegian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95095;The Norwegian government has formally requested to be granted full independence from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90110;The Manifesto de Montecristi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90110;Jose Martí, a Cuban intellectual and radical who has spent a great deal of time organizing émigrés in the United States, has returned to the colony and declared the Manifesto de Monticristi, an exposition of the purposes and principles of the coming Cuban revolution. It seems the uprising has been in the planning for some time, and if the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government intends to remain in control of Cuba it could have a battle ahead of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90115;The Maine Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90115;To hell with Spain! Remember the Maine!\n\nA riot by Cuban Spanish loyalists recently broke out in Havana, leading to the destruction of the printing presses of four local newspapers which criticized the Spanish Army. The battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in response to fears expressed by the American consulate that Americans in Cuba might be endangered. Not long after arriving, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour. American newspapers have leapt on the event, painting pictures of Spanish atrocities which have whipped up the public into a rage. People are calling for war against Spain and intervention in Cuba.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90120;The Propaganda Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90120;Three Filipino priests have been executed in the Manila, charged with subversion. While the executions are said to have been just, they are now considered martyrs by the Filipino people and have inspired the creation of a literary and organization known as 'the Propaganda Movement'. The organization consists of Filipino émigrés in Spain, primarily liberals and students, who are attempting to increase awareness of the needs of the Philippines and foster better relations between Spain and its colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90125;The Katipunan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90125;We have received reports from colonial officers in Manila regarding rumors of a secret organization called the 'Katipunan'. Formed by anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Filipinos, they reportedly seek complete independence for the Philippines. It's possible that limited home rule might mollify some of these revolutionaries, but nothing short of freedom will satisfy them for long. Tracking them down among sympathetic locals may prove difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90130;With the recent unrest in Cuba, the prospect of the Spanish government possibly selling the island to the United States has arisen. Should we attempt to pursue negotiations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90132;The Spanish Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90132;After some negotiation, conducted in secret, the Spanish have finally refused to sell Cuba. More than one member of the government has been angered by this, seeing the island as naturally falling into the American sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90133;Cuba is Ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90133;With no small amount of fanfare, Spain has agreed to the sale of Cuba to the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90135;The Grito de Lares;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90135;With conditions in our Puerto Rican colony so poor, the notion of independence has begun to spread among the local Caribenos. Reports from the colonial governor state a revolt has begun in the town of Lares, one that may be difficult to put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90140;The Intentona de Yauco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90140;We have received reports of an independence movement having been formed in Puerto Rico, with an uprising having been organized in the town of Yauco. While the movement doesn't yet have a great deal of support among local conservatives, many of whom are hoping there is still a chance to achieve independence from $COUNTRY$ through peaceful means, it's possible that their efforts could spread if we don't put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90904;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90904;Perhaps $FROMCOUNTRY$ has grown beyond our ability to control them? They have been far more welcoming of western ways, to the point that now they consider themselves 'civilized' and on par with the barbarians outside of $COUNTRY$... Indeed, they even consider themselves above us, and have thrown off $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule as if it were a bad shadow. They seek to chart an independent course, but should we let them? Should we allow them to pretend they are not part of China, and reject the heritage of thousand thousand years?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95026;Liberian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME95076;The January Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95076;A spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army has quickly erupted into a widespread insurrection, supported by high-ranking Polish and Lithuanian officers and politicians. The eyes of all of Europe are upon us, and if we deal with the insurgents too harshly it may hurt our relations with European powers. If we do not, however, the uprising may spread even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC95200;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Turkmen peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership.

EVTDESC95250;Brunei's control over the southern regions has only ever been nominal, and the region has been self-governed under the Sultan of Sarawak. During a recent crisis, an Englishman by the name of James Brooke provided the Sultan invaluable assistance in restoring order, and has been bestowed with the title of governor. This 'White Rajah' is now effectively the ruler, and is seeking alliance with Brunei. We must either recognize the independence of an area we only barely controlled, or seek to assert our authority and perhaps anger the English in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95251;The Dutch East Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95251;The Dutch East India Company has been slowly spreading its influence within the East Indies, and is urging our government to establish protectorates over the remaining sultanates on the islands. Indeed, they have been stirring up trouble in the region.

EVTDESC95265;'On this day in the year of our lord, $YEAR$, do we declare the Union to be defunct, a relic of the past now only a shadow of its former greatness. We delegates hereby declare ourselves the inheritors of that once-great legacy, and forever more shall we be known as the Free States of America.'/n/nWith those words,delegates from several states in the north have gathered in Philadelphia and declared their secession from the Union. Whether we can move fast enough to ensure those states never act upon the declaration, or whether others will heed the call of these so-called 'Free Staters' remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95266;The Congress of $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95266;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Free States of America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95267;The New Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95267;'Whereas once the dream of our rightful independence was crushed, we stand here in the city of Richmond to declare that it has been reborn. No longer can the South remain under the heel of the North and call it freedom-- the Confederacy must rise again!'/n/nWith those words, a large group of delegates gathered in Richmond have declared the Confederate States of America reborn. At least one state has agreed to secede, and its possible that others will join them… now or very soon. If we are to stop this new rebellion, we will need to act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95268;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Confederate States of America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95269;The Secession of Oregon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95269;'Whereas once our land was the frontier of America, now it is the frontier of freedom. The Oregon Country is a land where men achieve their destiny through honest toil and while believing in the equality of men. Since the Union no longer believes in the same, we hereby declare it dead.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Portland have declared the secession of Oregon from the Union. While other parts of the region may join them, it's unknown whether everyone there feels the same. Clearly this rebellion must be stopped before it gains further traction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95270;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Oregon Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95271;The Colorado Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95271;'We are the true heartland of America. We know things that Washington has forgotten: the value of honesty, the need for virtue, and the true meaning of freedom. What they have put aside, we shall pick up and keep close to our hearts-- for now, a new nation is born. A republic that will stand the test of time as the nation we step away from has not.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathered in the city of Denver has declared the creation of the Colorado Republic. Whether more states will join their rebellion still remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95272;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Colorado Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95273;The Chicago Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95273;'What the fools in Washington have forgotten is that we are not their subjects. We are their allies. If they abuse us, we do not lie back and ask for forgiveness. We leave. That is what we do here today: we are forging a new alliance of equals, brothers with a common heritage who will never forget the evils that lie in tyranny and corruption.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Chicago have declared the formation of a 'New American Alliance'. The state of Illinois has seceded from the Union to create it, and it's entirely possible that others will join them if we do not act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95274;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the New American Alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95275;The Dakota Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95275;'Ours is a nation born of resolution. The Washington government thought it could stretch its hand across the breadth of North America, that all they touched would bow down and be forever grateful for their overlordship. We say it is not so, and stand here today to proclaim that there is a better way.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathered in Rapid City have declared the formation of the 'Dakota Republic'. South Dakota has seceded from the Union, and it's possible that others may soon join them. Do they not realize how short-lived their rebellion will surely be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95276;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Dakota Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95277;The Pueblo Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95277;'We have been the subjects of despots in Mexico as well as cruel tyrants in Washington, and we stand here before you today to declare that we will stand for neither. Ours is a unique heritage, and we will move forward with the intention of celebrating it in the spirit of freedom and goodwill for all mankind.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathered in Phoenix have declared the formation of a 'Pueblo Republic'. Arizona and New Mexico have both seceded from the union to form it, daring us to stop their rebellion-- if we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95278;The Mormon Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95278;'Our path lies in a different direction -- with our hearts, our faith, and our integrity. May God watch over us and keep us safe in this perilous world.'/n/nWith these words, the leader of the Mormons has declared the formation of the independent nation of Deseret, encompassing both Utah and Nevada. They stand ready to resist any attempt by us to retake them through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95279;The Convention of San Francisco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95279;'Our joining of the Union was with the understanding that it meant something-- we were joining a cause for true freedom in a world full of totalitarianism, a cause far greater than any we could hope to achieve on our own. We were mistaken, and now we must march forward on our own terms. May God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of California met with a large number of delegates in San Francisco and declared their state seceded from the Union-- to the widespread support of many Californians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95280;The Texas Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95280;'We are the Lone Star State. We fought against the Mexicans and succeeded, and now we shall fight against the Yankees if they come. Let them come. Texas bows before no-one.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Texas stood before a group of gathered delegates and declared their state seceded from the Union. Already an army of supporters is gathering in Austin, ready to fight against any reprisal from Washington.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95281;The Convention of Boston;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95281;'We stand here in Boston, the birthplace of this nation and the home of the Liberty Bell. Let the bell ring, let it announce to the world that our beloved homeland has fallen from grace. It is up to the Sons of Liberty to rise in its place, to fight for truth and freedom wherever its meaning has been lost. We will brook no tyrants in America.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates from throughout New England have declared their states seceded from the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95282;The Alaskan Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95282;'We are the true North, the furthest frontier of the United States. We are a sturdy people who will stand on our own when called to-- and that call goes out to you now. Alaska never sought its independence, but it will stand for what's right. God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Alaska spoke to delegates gathered at Stika and announced that the state-- cut off from support by the rest of the nation-- was forced to stand on its own. Whether the state intends to one day rejoin the Union if that situation changes is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95283;The Honolulu Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95283;'Once we were a nation of our own, but we joined with the United States and have earned our place in the Union. We are a hard-working people who will do whatever must be done-- and now we must act. Hawaii never sought its independence, but it will stand for what's right. God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Hawaii spoke to delegates gathered at Honolulu and announced that the state-- cut off from support by the rest of the nation-- was forced to stand on its own. Whether the state intends to one day rejoin the Union if that situation changes is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95315;Join the Canadian Confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95315;With things in $COUNTRY$ so difficult, some citizens have brought up the possibility of joining the Confederation of Canada. It is a land of freedom, and together we will be more powerful than we are separately. Shall we approach their government?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95316;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Asks to Join Canada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95316;A delegate from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has quietly approached the Canadian government, asking for the former American state to be admitted to Confederation. While this may seem like a good idea, the Americans may see us as opportunists for accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95500;The $CAPITAL$ Conference of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95500;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. The outcome has become known as the 'General Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference', formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95501;The Scramble for Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95501;A conference has been held in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attended by all colonial powers, to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. A general agreement has been reached, formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95502;The Age of Colonialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95502;Word has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that African nations would be divided up amongst them-- as if our people were little more than children's toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95503;$COUNTRY$ in the Modern Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95503;'We have seen the outsiders. They come, with guns and riches we have never seen before. What they also bring is death, and we must always be wary what lies behind their smiles.'\n\n$COUNTRY$ stands on good terms with much of the western world, but our leaders are all too aware how quickly that could change. The Europeans believe we are not civilized, and the tone of our contact with them is slowly changing from friendly interest in trade to a strange paternalism coupled with cultural superiority. For now, $COUNTRY$ survives... but we must watch for the moment when the civilized nations decide our enslavement is the only way we can be 'saved'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95504;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Jihad;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95504;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ muslims are calling for the Jihad to continue: all Islamic states of the Sahel, united under one flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95505;Imperialism Comes to $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95505;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses-- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95506;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95506;Our presence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached the point where $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence is felt in every level of their society. They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official. Shall we agree to make $FROMCOUNTRY$ a protectorate and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, or support their independence as a friendly ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95507;Nationals Expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95507;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95508;The Sale of Assab;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95508;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ shipping company has come into the ownership of the Red Sea port of Assab, sold to them by a local Afar sultan. The port would make for an excellent coaling station, and perhaps even provide a base for $COUNTRY$ to expand our influence in the area. Pushing for more direct control, however, could cause tensions with Assab's owner -- who might feel they have greater right to the port than the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95509;The Red Sea port of Assab has been sold to $FROMCOUNTRY$ by the local Afar sultan. They have begun to use the port as a coaling station, and fears within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are that they will use this base to expand their influence within $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95510;Rebellion in Eritrea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95510;With the Sudan in chaos, the Ethiopians have taken advantage of the situation to regain control over the Eritrean coastlands. Though we may yet regain control over the Sudan, we should consider whether the Eritreans must be punished for this trespass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95610;The Great Game;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95610;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep... And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95611;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion. If we do not press south, Russia will soon have its southern borders exposed to European invasion. It does us no good to allow the British complete hegemony over Central Asia. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95612;The Great Game Comes To $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between. Recently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers got into a skirmish with one of our neighbours... and the resulting incident has brought the infernal gaze of one of these powers upon us, perhaps meaning war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95613;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Border Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its maneuvering, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95614;Peace With $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95614;It seems that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is content to accept the incident was not our intent and turn its attentions elsewhere. For the moment, $COUNTRY$ is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95616;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95616;Unrest within $FROMCOUNTRY$ against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has reached a boiling point, and it appears the only solution is to step in and rule them directly. Should we fail to do so, we may find $FROMCOUNTRY$ soon taken from our control and turned into a target for a foreign power's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95640;Persecution of French Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95645;The Suzerainty of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95646;The King of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the French intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the French and asked for protection, and the French have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95650;French Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbours. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95652;French diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the French claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet… do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95655;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the French onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the French at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96090;End of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96090;With the loss of $COUNTRY$ in the recent war, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy has received much of the blame-- there have already been several assassination attempts, and calls within the government for the monarchy to step down. Sentiment in the public has turned to the notion of $COUNTRY$ becoming a democracy... though some fear this will plunge the nation into even further chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96100;The Arab Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96100;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Mashriqi, fueled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Our governors in the region are understandably nervous, and report that we can expect major rebellions in the coming years unless we are very careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96101;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Self-Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96101;We have been granted self-rule by our $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96102;The Arab Revolt has begun, and many people in $CAPITAL$ are flying the revolt flag. They are demanding freedom from foreigner rule, and we will have difficulty keeping them under control... provided that's what we wish to do, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96105;End of the Arab Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96105;The general insurgency by $COUNTRY$'s Arab population has been brought to an end. For the moment, peace has been restored and the momentum of the Arab resistance dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96110;The House of Saud Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96110;Abdul-Aziz, scion of the House of Saud, has returned from exile in Kuwait. Not only that, the man has managed to forge an alliance with the southern Bedouin tribes and retaken Riyadh. We must deal with ibn Saud quickly, lest he retake even more land and reverse our earlier victory over his house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96115;The Rule of Hedjaz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96115;We have always been torn between our loyalty to Egypt and to the Ottoman Empire. The time has come to decide between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96120;The House of Rashid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96120;The House of Saud will never unite Arabia so long as the Emirate of Ha'il stands on our northern border. We must marshal our force and bring them to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96121;The House of Saud;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96121;The House of Rashid will never unite Arabia so long as the Emirate of Nejd stands on our southern border. We must marshal our force and bring them to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96165;Italian Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96165;The Italians have managed to unify at long last, threatening $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the region. We will have to decide whether it is in our best interests to object or to make friends with the new rulers. What has been done cannot now be undone, after all, and a united Italy could be a formidable enemy or a powerful $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96170;Il Risorgimento;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96170;$COUNTRY$ has become the center of Italian nationalism, its people calling out for unification. Italian flags are flying in the streets of $CAPITAL$, and we must decide if we wish to support this call and bring all of Italy peacefully under our banner. If we refuse, our people will be upset... and it's unlikely the opportunity will arise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96215;Indian Nationalists Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96215;Nationalists have succeedeed in taking over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies in India. Our governors have been driven out and our territory lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97000;The Revolution of Maria de Fonte;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97000;A growing dissatisfaction with the ruling government among Portugal's poor has grown into rebellion, spurred on by popular discontent with the prohibition against burials inside churches. The instigator of the initial riots is a woman by the name of Maria, and her nickname has come to be used to represent the rebellion-- which has a large contingent of peasant women among its supporters -- and which has been co-opted by revolutionaries in emulation of the rebellions elsewhere in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97001;Peasant Revolt in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97001;The Maria de Fonte rebellion has spread to $PROVINCENAME$, with the lower classes rising up in opposition to the ruling government. Many are calling for the government's resignation, and there are signs that Queen Maria II may engineer a coup to restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97002;End of the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97002;Portuguese forces have managed to restore order in the countryside, and the peasantry have been brought back under control. The danger of a royal coup has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97003;The Emboscada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97003;Spurred on by the spreading revolts in Portugal, Queen Maria II has suspended the constitution and installed a reactionary government presided over by João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha. This has served to spur on the country's liberals to outrage, and begun talk of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97006;The Occupation of Angola;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97006;Our forces are slowly pacifying the Angolan countryside. If we are fortunate, we will one day be able to connect our African colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97007;The Occupation of Mozambique;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97007;Our forces are slowly pacifying the Mozambiquan countryside. If we are fortunate, we will one day be able to connect our African colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97010;The Portuguese Colonies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97010;We have received an ultimatum from $FROMCOUNTRY$: surrender our colonies between Angola and Mozambique or suffer the consequences. The Portuguese people feel this is an incredible betrayal by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$. They have traditionally been our ally, and now they are trying to bully our rightful colonial holdings out of us? It cannot be borne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97011;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97011;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to our terms-- though they are unhappy about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97012;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97012;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our ultimatum, and all but dared $COUNTRY$ to take their colonies from them-- if we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97015;Regicide of King Carlos I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97015;Upon returning to Lisbon from a brief trip abroad, King Carlos I and the royal family had their carriage fired upon by republican activists as they passed through the Terreiro do Paço. Three of the bullets struck and killed the King, while another fatally wounded the heir to the throne, Luis Filipe. During the turmoil, the police killed the assassins... but the King and the royal heir were not saved and were pronounced dead at the Naval Arsenal soon afterwards. Manuel, the king's youngest son, has been quickly acclaimed as the new King of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97020;The Republican Coup D'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97020;With the monarchy already weakened by the death of King Carlos, republican opponents have been able to gather considerable support in the capital. Members of the Carbonária, republican youth, and elements of the army have instigated a coup d'état in the palace. The young King Manuel and his family have reportedly escaped for exile to England, and only days later a new Portuguese Republic has been declared in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97050;The Peru-Bolivian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97050;The confederation of Peru, South Peru and Bolivia represents a threat to our interests. If the confederation is given time to solidify, they could easily become a new powerhouse in South America-- and one that is no friend to $COUNTRY$. Thankfully there are signs that the confederation is unstable: the Peruvians chafe at the Bolivian leadership, and given enough incentive they might withdraw. If we act now, we might be able to stir our people against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97055;End of the Confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97055;With the recent losses suffered by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces, confidence in the confederation has eroded. If we attempt to keep it together, we must do so by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97060;The Uruguayan Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97060;Brazil has traditionally held the right to intervene in Uruguayan internal affairs as it sees fit, but in recent months the conservative Blanco government has proven to be increasingly intransigent. The rebel leader of the liberal Colorados, Venancio Flores, has approached us with the offer of an alliance: place him in power and Brazil has a firm ally in Uruguay once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97061;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97061;After several recent political conflicts with Brazil, they have sent an ultimatum: place the rebel leader of the Colorados in charge of the government or there will be war. There are many in the government who feel that Brazil cannot be serious. Uruguay is no threat, and they would risk angering the Platine nations with an invasion? This insulting ultimatum should be refused, according to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97062;Uruguay Rejects the Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97062;The Uruguayan government has rejected our demands. Perhaps they underestimate our willingness to see this matter to a swift end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97065;We Must Submit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97065;We have no choice but to submit to the Brazilian demands. The Colorados are victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97066;The Blancos Have Surrendered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97066;The government of Uruguay has given in to our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97070;La Carta de la Esclavitud;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97070;General Juan José Flores, the president of the republic and considered by many to be its founder, has responded to his falling popularity by engaging in voting irregularities and seeking to annul the 1835 constitution in order to remain in power. This new constitution, nicknamed the 'Carta de la Esclavitud' (or the 'letter of slavery') would anger a great number of the country's liberal populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97075;The Era of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97075;Gabriel García Moreno, called the father of Ecuadorian conservatism, has risen to power during a time of crisis. To some, he is exactly what the country needs to see it through these troubled times. To others he is a tyrant. In either case, Moreno now rules Ecuador with an iron fist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97076;Settling Tarauaca;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97076;The jungles of Tarauaca lie in the heart of the Amazon, and rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$. Currently there are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ settlers eager for the opportunity to settle the region and have asked for the funds to assist them, though advisors say this may cause problems with neighboring states who also claim the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97080;Occupation of Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97080;Chilean forces have occupied more of the lands in the southern continent. The pacification of the local natives is ongoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97085;Conquest of the Desert;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97085;Argentinian forces have occupied more of the lands in the southern continent. The pacification of the local natives is ongoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97086;Pacification of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97086;Through the judicious use of force, confiscation of native lands and the introduction of roads and other vestiges of civilization, conditions in $PROVINCENAME$ have greatly improved. The native patagonians are proving to be contentious, but their numbers are far too few for us to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97090;The Argentina-Chile Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97090;Now that the lands of Araucania and Patagonia are fully settled, the Argentinians have approached us to work out a border treaty. They intend to claim the lands east of the Andes and are willing to concede the lands east of the Andes to us. If we do not come to an agreement, future conflict is almost guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97100;$PROVINCECULTURE$ Rebellion in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97100;A dispute between local $PROVINCECULTURE$ leaders and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials in $PROVINCENAME$ has exploded into a riot, and the violence quickly spread throughout $STATENAME$. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army is stamping out the rebellion as best it can, but fears persist that this could develop into a much larger problem if it continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97105;Rebellion Agaist Foreign Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97105;A dispute between $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrats and a foreign governor has exploded into a riots in $CAPITAL$. Many $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed from the yoke of its oppressor, and are ready to rise up and fight against the foreign armies that are sure to come. The idea that $COUNTRY$ may become a battleground pleases few, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97110;The Stirrings of Indian Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97110;The people of India are diverse, consisting of numerous cultures and languages throughout the sub-continent. Seldom has there been any serious credence given to the idea of a single union crossing all cultural boundaries, save by force of arms. This has recently changed, with Indian nationalists in $COUNTRY$ calling for a true union-- one powerful enough to resist all imperialist efforts to conquer it. Surprisingly, their calls have received a great deal of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Seldom has there been any serious credence given to the idea of a single union crossing all cultural boundaries, save by force of arms. This has recently changed, with nationalists in $FROMCOUNTRY$ calling for a true India-- one united and powerful enough to resist all imperialist efforts to conquer it. Surprisingly, their calls have received a great deal of attention in $COUNTRY$ and this unified nationalism has been rapidly spreading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97115;Death of the Maharajah;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97115;With the death of Ranjit Singh, a vacany has been left in the leadership of the Sikh Empire which will not be easily filled. The Maharajah's heir died suspiciously within months, as did the heir to follow, all due to infighting among the princes and the Panjabi nobility struggling to maintain power. Many fear this weakness will surely bring the British down upon the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97120;Retreat From India?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97120;Our lands in the Indian Raj have been overrun, our enemies among the Indians having successfully driven us off the subcontinent. We have been forced to consider whether we should retreat from India altogether. There are those in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who say the time has come: clearly the Indians wish us gone. Others say we must not submit to what amounts to a temporary setback. The Indians can be forced to submit, if we focus our efforts on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97121;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Retreats From India!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97121;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to an abrupt end. With most of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ India either occupied or in disarray, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to retreat from the subcontinent completely. Governors have been spotted fleeing, leaving colonial mansions completely emptied. While this does leave the nation in a state of relative chaos, a great $COUNTRY_ADJ$ victory has been achieved! India is at last freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97150;The Talambó Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97150;An alarming incident has occurred at the Talambó hacienda in Ica. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who has subsequently demanded the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Considering it was not long ago that $COUNTRY$ fought for its independence from Spain, submitting to such an indignity would go over less than well with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97151;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. They have done so, but some advisors bring up a possibility: if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is this fearful of Spanish power, perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over our lost Spanish colonies? Cutting $FROMCOUNTRY$ down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97152;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility. Perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over $FROMCOUNTRY$? Cutting them down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97153;The Spanish Royal Commissary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97155;Submitting to Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97155;We have been overrun by Spain, and now have no choice but to surrender our sovereignty to our former colonial overlords. It is a bitter day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97156;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Submits;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose. Some might wonder if it's worthwhile for Spain to involve itself in South American affairs, particularly since they will ultimately try to rebel out from under us. Perhaps we have proven our point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97160;The Return of the Imperialists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are rightfully worried at what this means, and there are calls for us to take a stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97161;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Protests;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97161;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has issued a protest to our involvement in South America, telling us in no uncertain terms that we are not welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97165;Appeal to America?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97165;The United States claims it intends to protect the New World from encroachment from imperial powers in Europe. Now that Spain has made its imperialist intentions evident, perhaps it is time we put the so-called Monroe Doctrine to the test?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97166;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Requests Aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe -- such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97700;Patriot Rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97700;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and have gained control of the capital. They send word they wish to bring all our lost provinces back to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97181;Colonial Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97500;Sovereign Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97501;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Our Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97502;French Escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places-- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97505;French Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97507;The War is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet-- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current wargoals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97510;The Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail). Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97515;Romanian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our indpendence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97517;The Russians Have Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97517;We have received word from the Russian government: they have agreed to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97518;The Russians Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97518;We have received word from the Russian government: they have refused to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97525;The cursed Romanians have coaxed the Russians into declaring war on us in support of their independence. We cannot let this stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97526;The Romanians have foolishly declared them independence. We must take action at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97550;The Federal Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97550;The Federal Republic of Central America has been chaotic since its inception. Liberals who had high hopes for the union are in constant battle with conservatives, in particular the clergy and wealthy landowners, and there is a general fear of domination by Guatemala. At this point, the struggle to maintain the union seems like an almost impossible one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97551;Costa Rica Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97551;With rebels in Nicaragua having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in southern Costa Rica. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in San Jose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97552;Nicaragua Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97552;With rebels in Honduras having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in Nicaragua. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in Managua.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME975521;Honduras Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC975521;With rebels rampant in the south, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in Honduras. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in Comayagua.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97553;Order Restored in El Salvador;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97553;The government has managed to restore order in the El Salvador region. Officials in San Salvador have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97554;Order Restored in Honduras;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97554;The government has managed to restore order in the Honduras region. Officials in Comayagua have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97555;The government has managed to restore order in the Nicaragua region. Officials in Managua have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97556;Order Restored in Costa Rica;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97556;The government has managed to restore order in the Costa Rica region. Officials in San Jose have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97560;End of the Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97560;The Federal Republic of Central America is rapidly disintegrating. Members of the government have met in $CAPITAL$ to discuss whether the union should be officially dissolved and the state of Guatemala declared, or whether we should fight to preserve what we have. Some consider that to be an impossible task, though liberals argue that we should not allow conservatives doom the region to a future of division and internal squabbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97561;Rebels in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$. Without the forces to oppose them, there is little we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97562;$CAPITAL$ Burns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97562;$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties-- no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$'s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97566;Trouble in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97566;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is besieged by rebels, and threatens to fall if they do not receive assistance from $COUNTRY$. They warn us that if the rebels are successful, it's very likely that $FROMCOUNTRY$ would cease to be in $COUNTRY$'s sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97570;Conflict with the Xhosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97570;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of British farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97571;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97571;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97600;Sakoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97601;Rangaku;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima. Despite the enforced isolation of the nation, this policy of learning allowed western influences to spread-- particularly in the southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97605;Kurofune;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97606;Commodore Perry Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97606;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with a treaty in hand: we have gained numerous trade concessions, but more importantly we have cracked open the shield that is Japan's policy of isolation. This is a great coup for American diplomacy and influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97607;The Japanese Are Defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97607;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with unfortunate news: they have chosen to defy his ultimatum and thumb their collective noses at our government. Should we back down now, it will be a great blow to our prestige and our influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97608;Japanese Surrender?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97608;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of western armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated foreigners terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97609;The Japanese Have Surrendered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97609;We have formally concluded a treaty with the Japanese which will see our influence restored, and our demands for their ports to be opened to our ships to be met. Additionally, an indemnity will be placed upon their government to make up for the expense of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97610;The Japanese Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97610;Despite the overwhelming odds against them, the Japanese have refused our generous offer of surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97615;Sonno Joi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97615;'Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!'\n\nThis is the slogan chanted by neo-confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa shogunate's opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen but also against the shogunate itself. Each incident chips away at Tokugawa control over the daimyo and erodes relations with the western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97616;$PROVINCENAME$ Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97616;There has been an incident in $PROVINCENAME$ where samurai, acting under the political slogan of 'Sonno Joi', have committed violence against foreigners conducting business in $STATENAME$. The incident has affected the Tokugawa shogunate's relations with foreign powers, as well as incited locals into riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97617;Order to Expel the Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97617;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, is a challenge to the shogunate's power, and may serve to further incite rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97618;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, and is a challenge to the shogunate's power. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan must decide whether it supports the Emperor's edict or quietly opposes it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97620;The Death of Iesada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi-- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97621;Tokugawa Yoshinobu is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97623;Tokugawa Iemochi is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama. It is becoming increasingly clear that a larger change is necessary. Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97624;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the fudai daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the outsider tozama will have their influence in the bakufu kept to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97625;Sakuradamon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97625;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point. Many are urging that a policy of Kobu Gattai-- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court-- may be required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, and thus the bakufu has begun a compromise policy of Kobu Gattai-- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court. Some are seeing this as a sign of further weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, yet the shogunate refuses to compromise with the imperial court. Many are certain this will only speed up the coming conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97630;The Death of Emperor Komei;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97630;There are some who believe that Emperor Komei was assassinated-- delivered a handkerchief laced with smallpox, perhaps by radicals who fear the possibility of compromise between the bakufu and the imperial court. No matter the truth, the death of the Emperor has placed the young Emperor Meiji upon the imperial throne and eliminated any chance of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97636;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. We have received word that the shogunate has consulted with the outsider tozama, perhaps seeking new allies. If so, this compounds injury with insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97640;The Meiji Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97640;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over all of Japan. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ must make a decision: do we throw in our support with the imperial court, or do we uphold our duty and support the shogun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have seized control of the palace at Kyoto and declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over Japan. Word has it they have recruited fellow daimyo to stand with them in this traitorous war. We must issue a call to our allies and move at once!\n\n§RNOTE: To win this war, you must occupy Kyoto and the rebellion leader's capital. You must not allow Edo to become occupied, and you cannot White Peace. If you White Peace, you lose.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97642;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over all of Japan.

The time has come to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97645;The Edo palace has been occupied, and our loyal daimyo are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Emperor his victory. There is a place for the Tokugawa within the new order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97646;The Meiji Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97646;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan forces have marched triumphantly into Edo, and the Tokugawa shogunate has agreed to a permanent peace. For the first time since before the Sengoku, the Imperial Court now rules Japan once again. Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97647;Emperor Meiji has been restored to rule over Japan. An imperial messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our willing allegiance to the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97648;A New Capital in the East?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97648;While Kyoto has long been the capital of Japan, and home to the Imperial Court, the city of Edo has become the de facto capital-- for centuries it has been the center of shogunate power, as well as a cultural and administrative center. The Emperor will need to decide whether the court should move to Edo and create a new capital... or remain in Kyoto and revitalize it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97650;We Are Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97650;The Imperial palace at Kyoto has been occupied, and our daimyo allies are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Shogun his victory. If we are fortunate, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan will not be wiped out by this unfortunate turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97651;Tokugawa Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97651;Tokugawa clan forces have marched triumphantly into Kyoto, and the traitor daimyos have agreed to a permanent peace. The Bakumatsu has ended with the shogunate in control once again-- victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97652;The Tokugawa shogunate has once again asserted control over Japan. A bakufu messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our submission to direct rule from Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97605;More 'black ships' have appeared off our shores, these ones commanded by an American named Commodore Matthew Perry. The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku-- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97660;The Taisho Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97665;The Satsuma Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion. Led by one of the most prestigious samurai leaders of the former Satsuma Domain, Saigo Takamori, the rebellion has attracted a large number of followers and will be a severe challenge for the Japanese government to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97670;The Northern Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97670;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings on Hokkaido, and we must seek to claim these places before the Russians do so first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97673;The Path of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97673;$COUNTRY$ has followed a militaristic path until now, determined to set ourselves against our neighbours in the interest of security-- while risking that security with dangerous wars. The new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has determined that this must change. We must follow a path of progress, and instead devote outselves to technology and westernization if we are to remain free and whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97674;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97674;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe. We now see this is in error, and that only by an aggressive expansion of our borders can we hope to maintain the security of $COUNTRY$ proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97675;China in Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97675;The Chinese have fallen into warring factions, all but crumbling their power and leaving us an advantage we would be fools not to exploit. The Line of Advantage policy dictates that we should strike, and strike soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97676;War With $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97676;Believing $COUNTRY$ to be weak, the hated Japanese have decided to strike at us and take control of our government. They shall find us a difficult target!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97677;The Korean Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97677;Our nation's policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighbouring Korea. They must either be brought under our direct control or made into a vassal if $COUNTRY$ is to be kept safe. Already $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals are clamoring for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97678;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97678;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97679;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97679;After the recent murders of a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ sailors off the coast of Formosa, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has delivered a demand: turn over the island, for the sake of their security, or it shall be war between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$. We know this is just an excuse for their militarist expansion... but can we stand up against their might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98000;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98000;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98001;The South African Union ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98001;The time has come to consider joining the South African union. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98002;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98002;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98003;The Anglo-Boer War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98003;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98004;South Africa is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98004;We control the entire Cape Colony. There is no question now as to who the masters are in South Africa: the Boers. The time has come for us to end the war and unite the Boers under a single flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98005;Appeal From $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98005;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98006;The Boer Exodus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98006;With 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave the Cape Colony behind and travel to either the Transvaal or the oranje Free State where they feel they will be free to pursue their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98007;Hungarian Revolutionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98007;There has been general discontent among the Hungarians, and a group of young revolutionaries have appeared to demand a number of concessions including freedom of the press. Giving them even that will not satisfy them completely, but it might give the government time to put down this rebellion before it begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98008;Czech Radicals Attempt Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98008;A group of Czech radical democrats attempted to overthrow the government in a coup. They were unsuccessful, but their actions have inspired their countrymen to rise up in demand of freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98100;The Ladder Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98100;The treatment of slaves in Cuba has become increasingly harsh after recent unrest, culminating in the so-called 'Ladder Conspiracy' which relates to a method of torture involving tying a slave to a ladder and whipping them until they confess or die. Reformists in the colony have been calling for a change in Spanish policy and an end to the slave trade there. Failure to do so could result in more uprisings, but bowing to such pressure could have serious repercussions back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98105;The Cry of Yara;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98105;Cuban sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes has issued the 'Grito de Yara', the 'Cry of Yara', declaring Cuban independence from $COUNTRY$ and freedom for his slaves. The man has many followers, and his call has spread rapidly throughout the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98200;The Great Boer Trek;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with British rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the northeast, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the British government is concerned, the Boers are British subjects... no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98205;Invasion of the Laagers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from British rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98206;The Battle of Blood River;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony-- with the only question remaining whether the British will recognize their independence or continue to treat them as subjects of the crown. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98207;The Natalia Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are British subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98210;British Rule of Natal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are once again chafing under British rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they have not escaped the British crown. There have been several altercations with British military foces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way-- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98211;Natalian Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, the British crown has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence. Finally we will control our own destiny, away from the British now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98212;The Annexation of Natalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, we have received a demand from the British government that Natalia be annexed into the Cape Colony. For all our struggles to leave the British behind, they yet follow us and refuse to allow us independence! So now we are faced with a choice: submit and move on, to find a place beyond their reach once more, or defy them and risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98213;The Boers Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98213;We have received word from the Natalian government defying our annexation. Now we must either go to war or stand down in humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98215;The Orange River Sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98215;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Basotho. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Orange River valley and established a new colony-- one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98216;The Boers Overtake the Orange Valley;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98216;We have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Orange Valley and declared it their own. This is an outrage... yet what can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98220;The Transvaal Sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98220;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Ndebele. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Transvaal and established a new colony-- one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98221;The Boers Overtake the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98221;We have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Transvaal and declared it their own. This is an outrage... yet what can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98225;The Boer Exodus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98225;With 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave $PROVINCENAME$ behind and travel to either the Transvaal or the Oranje Free State where they feel they will be free to pursue their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98230;Sand River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98230;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial authorities have met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to determine the requirements for our independence. They wish to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ remain strong, and would see us abandon any laws allowing slavery or the 'unethical' treatment of foreigners working in our territory ('uitlanders', as they are called). While our independence is a foregone conclusion, we must decide just how much we abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98231;Orange River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98235;Migrants have been moving in large numbers through our African colonies on their way to the newly incorporated town of 'Johannesburg', on the edge of the Witwatersrand mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place. The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders and friction between our governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98236;Kimberley Goldrush;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98236;Gold has been discovered in the Kimberley province, leading to claims from both the Transvaal and Oranje governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Kimberley being awarded to the griquas-- who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Boer and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98240;The South African Union ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98240;The time has come to consider joining the South African union. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98241;Appeal From $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98241;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98245;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98246;The Anglo-Boer War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98246;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98247;South Africa is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98247;The Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them. It seems we have little choice, with the war going so badly and Cape Town already occupied. All we can do is decide whether we will pursue a conciliatory path with the Boers and perhaps make them future allies or aim at returning in the future and reclaiming what has been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98248;The Treaty of Vereeniging;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98248;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone is one of reconciliation, and it is clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ wishes to build good relations with us after the business of this war is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98249;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone of the talks has been very bitter, and it's clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government will do all it can to return and trouble us again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98250;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98250;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98255;Conflict with the Xhosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of British farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98256;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98260;Walvis Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98260;Other European nations are eyeing the region of Namaqualand, directly to the north of our holdings in the Cape Colony. To forestall their ambitions, it has been recommended that we establish an enclave at Walvis Bay and incorporate it into our southern colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98261;The Northern Cape Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98261;Many British settlers are pushing north of the Cape Colony into areas only tenuously claimed by our government. We should consider increasing our presence in the region and establishing greater colonial government, before another country comes and claims it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98300;War-Time Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98301;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98302;Anger Against the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems-- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98303;Contentious Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98304;Government Supporters Rally;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98305;Orderly Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly. Debates are being carried out in the usual manner, and there are no reports of violence in $CAPITAL$ or elsewhere. Supporters of the ruling regime have turned out in force, as have the hopefuls seeking to defeat the current government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98310;Conservatives Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98310;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the conservative party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98311;Socialists Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98311;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the socialist party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98312;Liberals Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98312;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the liberal party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98313;Communists Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98313;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the communist party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98314;Fascists Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98314;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the fascist party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98315;Reactionaries Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98315;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the reactionary party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98316;Anarcho-Liberals Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98316;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the anarcho-liberal party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98317;Social Liberals Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98317;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the social liberal party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98400;The Jewish Diaspora;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98400;Now that a true Jewish homeland has been established, Israel will begin to draw many Jewish people who live in countries across the world-- though this will inevitably anger many neighboring Islamic countries who object to its presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98405;The Jewish Homeland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98405;Jewish families in $PROVINCENAME$, having originally arrived in $COUNTRY$ as a result of the diaspora," are reportedly planning on emigrating to Israel-- the newly-established Jewish homeland in the Palestine. We could encourage them to remain, but that might not be a simple matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;
EVTNAME98600;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war. Any attempts to achieve independence should ideally take a diplomatic route first, with friendly ties maintained if peaceful separation becomes a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98605;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion-- and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98606;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion-- as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98607;$COUNTRY$ Granted Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98610;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence-- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98611;Must We Fight Alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98612;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98620;Christian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98620;The Ottoman government had a number of policies regarding the treatment of Christians within the Empire which were considered oppressive: the capitulation tax, known as the Jizya, as well as controls over Christians which did not permit them to become soldiers or hold public office. It was not until the Hatt-i Humayun in 1856-- also known as the Imperial Reform Edict, part of the Tanzimat Reforms-- that things actually began to improve for minorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98625;The Kanûn-i Esâsî;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98625;A group of liberal intellectuals known as the 'Young Ottomans', led by the statesman reformer Midhat Pasha and influenced by the Liberal Revolutions elsewhere in Europe, have proposed a new constitution-- the 'Kanûn-i Esâsî' or 'Basic Law'-- which would see an elected parliament created, would limit the powers of the Sultan, and speed up the Tanzimat Reforms. Conservative members of the Ottoman government claim that giving into these liberals will only speed up the erosion of long-held traditions, while others say that the reforms are sorely needed to stave off the decline of the Empire at the hands of nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98626;The Empire in Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants-- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force-- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98630;Inspired Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98635;The Young Turks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the consitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98636;Turkish Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy-- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Unification!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98650;The call from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to $COUNTRY$, asking us to unify with their nation into a greater state-- one which will forge a greater power in a new world order. There are those $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who fear losing our identity in such a union, but many welcome the nation and rightly state that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s influence in $COUNTRY$ is already great. If we deny the union, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government may decide to enforce their claim on us whether we like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98651;Islamic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98651;The call from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to $COUNTRY$, asking us to unify with their nation into a greater Islamic state-- one which will forge new world power. There are those $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who fear losing our identity in such a union, and some who object to our joining with a country ruled by fundamentalists. But, for the good of all Islamic peoples, should we not consider our fate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98655;Hungarians Agree to Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98655;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures even if it means giving up some of their traditional claims to those lands. We may now proceed to propose the union to other local governments with full confidence that both our governments are behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98656;The Hungarian Counter-Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98656;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures... on one condition: that they be elevated to a fully autonomous state tied to the federation only in matters of foreign relations. We can ignore their proposal, but not without causing a great deal of discontent among the Hungarian people. Sadly, this appears to be as far as their government will go on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98657;The Hungarians Refuse Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98657;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have outright refused the proposed federation. They do not wish to lose their equal standing with the Austrian government, and see no benefit in surrendering claims to their traditional territories. We can ignore their refusal and proceed with the federation anyhow, but not without upsetting the Hungarian people greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME98710;The Hungarian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98710;Resentment has been brewing among Hungarians ever since the federation's formation.

EVTNAME98720;End of the Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98720;With the loss of Hungary, the entire basis for the Danubian Federation has begun to crumble. The other ethnic groups are questioning the dominance that the German majority will exert without the Hungarians to counter-balance them, and increasingly there are demands for the federation to be undone. Some Germans are fine with this, preferring to return to the Austria that was, but many of them say that these other groups should not be permitted to break away. They say the Austrian Empire should be restored-- by force, if need be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98721;With the Danubian government having become a totalitarian regime, resentment among the various ethnic groups has reached a boiling point. They are demanding their independence, something which would see an end to the federation as it currently exists. The German majority is fine with this, though some are also suggesting the temerity of these rebels is beyond the pale and the federation should be maintained-- by force, if need be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98725;The Call for Arab Unity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98725;The call has gone out across the world: a nation has risen to lead the arab masses into the future, a greater power that can withstand the onslaught of colonialism by the European powers. They must rise up and join $COUNTRY$, or forever spend their lives as servants to foreign masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98735;Islamic Fervor in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME1316081;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316081;A drunken riot by a large group of British sailors ashore at Kowloon has resulted in the death of a local man. By rights, the sailors should be tried and executed by the Qing magistrate. The British, however, have demanded extraterritoriality-- meaning their citizens would be tried by British judges. This will inevitably lead to their release and the anger of our citizens, but demanding these mens' executions could lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316082;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316082;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well. These damnable foreigners are in our lands and blockading our ports, and to the embarassment of our government there seems to be little we can do to stop them. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us to negotiate a 'fair' settlement. While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them a concession port and reparations. Indeed, this might even help us in some ways, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1316175;We have lost all patience with the barbarians who call themselves our 'masters'.

EVTNAME1316176;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Envoy Ejected;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316176;Relations have been cool with $FROMCOUNTRY$, laced with bitterness over our nation's superiority. Lately the situation has reached a boiling point, and we have received a report that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ envoy to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ court has been ejected. Indeed, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals throughout $FROMCOUNTRY$ are reporting harassment and outright violence. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ are being refused berth at Chinese harbors. This is a systematic campaign by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ emperor to reduce our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316180;Empire of the Great Qing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316180;China has no need for, nor interest in, foreigners and their gifts no matter how ingenious they may be. It is only due to the emperor's generosity that foreigners are allowed to trade at all, and all such trade must take place at our will. The yi barbarians should tremble as they obey us and show no negligence! Barbarians shall bow down before the Chinese emperor in the manner customary for tributary envoys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316181;The Arrow Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316181;Qing officials recently boarded the Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship (a lorcha) that was suspected of piracy and smuggling. Twelve Chinese crew members were arrested on suspicion of piracy by the Qing authorities. British officials have demanded the release of the sailors, however, claiming that because the ship had recently been British-registered, it was under their protection. The Imperial court has been enraged by this claim, suggesting that agreeing to British demands would give smugglers free reign throughout China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316182;Qing officials recently boarded the Arrow, a ship that-- according to all reports-- was flying British colors at the time. The Chinese claim this isn't the case, and we've received news that they intend to crack down on the opium trade throughout the Empire. The British government is up in arms, saying that we must exert our influence over the Qing if we are to retain our position in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131709;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131709;An incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qing government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge-- the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse. Our prestige as an Empire to be reckoned with is being threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131710;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131710;In a display of diplomatic force, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have forced $COUNTRY$ to sign a treaty with them, forcing numerous trade as well as territory concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131711;The Simla Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131711;British diplomats have approached the Tibet government, hoping to broker a peaceful arrangement between Tibet and China now that Tibet is independent.

EVTDESC131714;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have cooled as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131715;The New Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131715;Our efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces. The generals in charge of these forces, 'warlords' as some call them, have been gaining a great deal of power. They are part of the Beiyang Army, but fight amongst themselves... And, far worse, are critical of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We will need to watch these generals carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131720;Spread of Anhui Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131720;Warlord influence has begun to spread into $STATENAME$. These generals are still loyal to $COUNTRY$, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that they are taking control of a significant portion of the country. Officials in $CAPITAL$ are alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME131730;The Warlord Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131730;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their indepedence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China's destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131735;The Struggle for China;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131735;Now that we are free, we must choose where we stand in the ensuing struggle for the nation's destiny: either side with the Kuomintang and fight for domination of the republic or side with the Beiyang and fight for domination of a united China. Alternatively, we can declare our neutrality in the conflict and let the chips fall where they may.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131736;The Guominjun Clique;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131736;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general by the name of Feng Yuxiang has betrayed his superiors and broken off from the Beiyang armies. He and his supporters have taken the territory under their control and formed a new clique, swearing to topple the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131740;Leader of the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131740;The leaders of the Kuomintang are preparing for their drive on Beijing, and $COUNTRY$ is expected to answer the call. Either we side with Nationalist China now, or we must abandon the Kuomintang cause and seek our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has answered the call, and will unite their forces with ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131742;The War of Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131742;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are crying out for the nation to once again unify. We must gather our strength and strike out at those who would divide China, leaving it weak for foreigners to prey upon. Already the banners are in the streets, and $COUNTRY$'s generals are saying now is the time to launch an offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131743;War with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131743;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ army is massing on our mutual border, ready to make a massive offensive into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. It seems a war is upon us, whether we like it or not: either they destroy us or we destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131745;Chinese Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131745;The call has come from the capital: the era of warlords is over, and all the Chinese peoples must unite under a single flag. This means $COUNTRY$ must either submit to Beijing's rule or face more war against a strong and unified foe. Your generals stand ready to receive your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131746;The Island of Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131746;Now that we own the island of Formosa, the local Min population has begun to organize itself-- presumably towards the end of breaking away from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1600010;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared-- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible. If we do not act, however, the rebels will surely gain control over not only the south but perhaps all of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160004;Truce With the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160004;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory. We have forced a truce, and now the Manchu will need to deal with rebellions across their land as the people realize their mandate to rule no longer exists. All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army. There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Heavenly Kingdom must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160007;The War Against the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160007;The truce with the Qing Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Taiping Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160008;The Taiping Are Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160008;We have overthrown the hated Manchu and taken control of all China. Now, as the world watches, the true test comes: transforming the nation into the true Heavenly Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160012;Taiping Missionaries in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160012;We have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'. Their actions would not be so objectionable if they were not also preaching sedition against the Manchu-- and, far worse, though provincial governors have attempted to halt the missionaries this has only seemed to stir up support for them even further. There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160013;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160013;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $STATENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160017;Pro-Christian Riots in $STATENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160017;Followers of the 'Heavenly Kingdom' are causing further problems in the south. They are already heavily fortified within $PROVINCENAME$, and many Qing advisors consider it completely beyond our control. Anarchy seems rampant, and all throughout $STATENAME$ these rebels are shouting treason. Can nobody do something about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160020;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160020;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have spread their influence even further. According to officials in $STATENAME$, the Christian rebels have been spotted in $PROVINCENAME$ and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise throughout the entire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160025;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160025;Our beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away-- ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a proper republic is the way forward. Still others say the unthinkable-- that Hong Xiuquan's death is a sign that the Heavenly Kingdom has lost favor with God, and that the only way to restore it is restore the Qing Dynasty to the Imperial throne-- without, of course, allowing the Manchu to rule the south like errant lapdogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160026;Retreat to Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160026;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa. The suggestion among what little remains of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taibei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160501;Missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160501;Christian missionaries are stirring up trouble in southern China, handing out pamphlets in an effort to gain converts. This would not be so objectionable were the pamphlet not also preaching sedition against the Qing Dynasty. The fact that so many in $PROVINCENAME$ are willing to listen to these fools is worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160502;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160502;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $PROVINCENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1605020;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1605020;After a period of self-enforced isolation, Hong Xiuquan has died-- some say of poison, others of illness. Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qing dynasty. Others say that $COUNTRY$ must become a republic, in emulation of western powers. Whether $COUNTRY$ is ready for such a change is difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16050214;Retreat to Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050214;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan. The suggestion among what little remains of the Kuomintang government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taipei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.  We shall however never relinquish our rightful claim to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16050215;Victory over the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050215;With their armies deafeated, their provinces occupied and their government retreating to Taiwan it has become clear that the Kuomintang no longer has the will to fight.  We may now claim dominance over China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME162503;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC162503;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have infested yet another province. According to officials in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of Hong Xiuquan have been spotted and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164503;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164503;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164504;Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164505;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164505;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller has taken to walking the Southlands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164599;The Xinhai Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164599;The forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Emperor. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections. Army leaders, however, have threatened to oppose the Kuomintang and demanded the republic be under strict Beiyang control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164600;The Tongmenghui;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164600;Revolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or 'Chinese United League'. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisifed to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What's more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164601;Revolutionary Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164601;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$. The incident appears to have begun in $PROVINCENAME$, after a demonstration by local workers turned violent. Though authorities have already moved in, the damage is done. What remains is to determine how we react to this outrageous provocation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164602;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164602;Members of the proto-nationalist Yihetuan Movement, also known as the Boxers, have staged an uprising in $PROVINCENAME$. While the uprising was initially put down by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces, news of the movement's presence has spread throughout $STATENAME$ and already there are more reports of clashes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME199005;Prospector Strikes Coal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME199015;Cash Crops;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC199015;Considering the levels of unemployment in $PROVINCENAME$, local landowners have begun a movement to switch to the production of cash crops-- in this case cotton, which appears to suited to the local terrain.

EVTNAME800012;Intervention in $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800012;We have been secretly approached by certain members within the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, suggesting that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention to free them from foreign control might be in both our interests. $FROMCOUNTRY$ would be free to seek its own destiny, while $COUNTRY$ would gain an ally. The catch, of course, is that the attempt could look like interference to the rest of the world... and earn us the enmity of $FROMCOUNTRY$'s rulers in particular. If we make the attempt, we should learn of the results within a week at the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800013;A foreign power has meddled in the affairs of $FROMCOUNTRY$, taking advantage of the unrest there to engineer a coup which has freed them from our control. Our trusted servants in that nation have been either arrested or expelled, and now the world watches for our response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800015;The answer from $FROMCOUNTRY$ is clear: they won't intervene in our internal affairs. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800016;Intervention Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800016;$FROMCOUNTRY$ attempted to intervene, but the resulting orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$ has failed to drive out the influence of our overlord. Worse, it has resulted in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ being greatly damaged, as many see them as instigators rather than would-be liberators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800017;Free At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800017;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has supported the coud d'etat in $CAPITAL$, but with the change came an orgy of violence that has seen $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ damaged along with that of our overlord. Many people in $COUNTRY$ are left with hard feelings, and see $FROMCOUNTRY$ as an instigator rather than a liberator. What will come next depends entirely on whether reprisals will come our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800018;Free At Last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800018;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention has succeeded in freeing our government from foreign rule. After an orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$, citizens are celebrating in the streets. $COUNTRY$ has a new destiny as a truly independent nation... provided no reprisals come out way, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800021;Attempted Coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800021;A foreign power attempted to use their influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ to take advantage of the unrest there and free them from our control. Their efforts have come to naught, and their agents have been arrested and many of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ malcontents exposed and imprisoned. The question remains, however, as to what we will do in response to this outrage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800022;Attempt Thwarted;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800022;Our attempt to interfere in $FROMCOUNTRY$'s government was thwarted. We have lost influence there, and angered their overlord. This may lead to war, but we will have to wait and see what develops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800023;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Freed At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800023;Our attempt to engineer a coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$ was successful, but at the cost of a great deal of our influence there. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is angry, and it's possible their overlords may attempt to retaliate either against them or against us. We will have to wait and see what develops of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800024;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800024;Our attempt to engineer a coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$ was successful, and they are now an independent country as well as a useful ally. It's possible their overlords may attempt to retaliate either against them or against us. We shall have to wait and see what develops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC810055;Rebel leaders have announced from $CAPITAL$ that $COUNTRY$ has at last achieved independence.

EVTNAME800055;Rebellion in $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800055;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ goverment has been overthrown, and the rebel government has declared themselves free from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Many are calling for a restoration of order, while others are saying that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is too much trouble. If they want to be free, let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800056;Rebellion in our ally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800056;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been toppled, and the rebels blame $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence as one of the primary causes of the old regime's corruption. We have lost our influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as a result, and the only question that remains is whether we wish to press our claim by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800060;The Proletariat Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800060;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of communism in a neighboring state. If discovered, this could start a diplomatic incident and gain us infamy... but if we do not act, the workers around the world will continue to slave under bourgeois oppression.

EVTNAME800061;The Spread of Fascism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800061;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of fascism in a neighboring state.

EVTDESC800062;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of anarcho-liberalism in a neighboring state.

EVTDESC800063;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of democracy in a neighboring state.

EVTNAME800064;We Were Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800064; Several of our agents in $FROMCOUNTRY$ were discovered and interrogated, and word of our efforts have spread. This will have an impact on our infamy, and the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ may choose to take the issue as cause for war against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800065;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800065;We have reports of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda being spread in one of our border provinces. Clearly the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government does not respect our sovereignty.

EVTDESC800077;The summit in $CAPITAL$ was a smashing success! $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats left pleased with the progress, and our relations have improved significantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800078;$COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Summit of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800078;The summit in $CAPITAL$ unfortunately failed to make any significant progress. Talks with $FROMCOUNTRY$ stalled, and even with our common ideological ground there are just too many issues remaining between our nations to improve relations more than marginally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800079;$COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Summit of $YEAR$ a Disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800079;The summit in $CAPITAL$ went very poorly. There are too many issues between our nations, and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats left in a huff. Our relations have suffered as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800080;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800080;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent a polite refusal to our summit request, saying now is not a good time for a summit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800081;A Fascist Summit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800081;The time has come for the great fascist powers of the world to stand together. A summit has been proposed in $CAPITAL$ that would bring our nations closer, though it also has the chance of going badly and driving us further apart. Do we dare make the attempt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800082;An Anarcho-Liberal Summit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800082;The time has come for the great anarcho-liberal powers of the world to stand together. A summit has been proposed in $CAPITAL$ that would bring our nations closer, though it also has the chance of going badly and driving us further apart. Do we dare make the attempt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800083;A Summit of Equals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800083;The time has come for the great democratic powers of the world to stand together. A summit has been proposed in $CAPITAL$ that would bring our nations closer, though it also has the chance of going badly and driving us further apart. Do we dare make the attempt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800084;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800084;A violent incident has occurred at one of the foreign embassies in $CAPITAL$, spurred on by resentment towards their nation and its ideological hostility towards our communist regime. We will need to decide now whether we are conciliatory in our response, potentially losing prestige for the socialist movement, or whether we imply that their nation's policies are what led to this unfortunate event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800085;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800085;A violent incident has occurred at one of the foreign embassies in $CAPITAL$, spurred on by resentment towards their nation and its ideological hostility towards our fascist regime. We will need to decide now whether we are conciliatory in our response, potentially losing prestige for our nationalist movement, or whether we imply that their nation's policies are what led to this unfortunate event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800086;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800086;A violent incident has occurred at one of the foreign embassies in $CAPITAL$, spurred on by resentment towards their nation and its ideological hostility towards our anarcho-liberal regime. We will need to decide now whether we are conciliatory in our response, potentially losing prestige for our liberal movement, or whether we imply that their nation's policies are what led to this unfortunate event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800087;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800087;A violent incident has occurred at one of the foreign embassies in $CAPITAL$, spurred on by resentment towards their nation and its ideological extremism. We will need to decide now whether we are conciliatory in our response, potentially losing prestige for our nation and the cause of democracy in the world, or whether we imply that their nation's policies are what led to this unfortunate event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800088;Incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800088;A violent incident has occurred at one of the foreign embassies in $CAPITAL$, spurred on by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ resentment towards $COUNTRY$ and our ideology. Their response to the unfortunate event has thankfully been conciliatory, and our government has received an official apology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800089;Insult from $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800089;A violent incident has occurred at our embassy in $FROMCOUNTRY$, spurred on by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ resentment towards $COUNTRY$ and our ideology. Their response has been insulting, publicly blaming our policies even though their own careless disregard for the safety of our diplomats and their political upheaval is clearly at fault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800090;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Does Not Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800090;Despite our apology, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it is enraged by the incident and that our lack of control over our citizens is to blame. While they are seen as being unreasonably aggressive, war is even a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800091;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800091;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has accepted our apology for the incident, and while our relations have been damaged the incident has mostly blown over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800092;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Enraged;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800092;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ leaders have declared our actions outrageous, and that the incident was no doubt secretly supported by our government. They claim this provides them ample grounds for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800093;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Backs Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has backed down from escalating the incident into a war. The entire business has harmed relations between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800094;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800094;Several foreigners were attacked in $CAPITAL$, an incident spurred on by differences between their country and our government's communist policies. It has severely harmed our relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800095;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800095;Several foreigners were attacked in $CAPITAL$, an incident spurred on by differences between their country and our government's fascist policies. It has severely harmed our relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800096;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800096;Several foreigners were attacked in $CAPITAL$, an incident spurred on by differences between their country and our government's anarcho-liberal policies. It has severely harmed our relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800097;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800097;Several foreigners were attacked in $CAPITAL$, an incident spurred on by differences between their country's radical ideology and our government's policies. It has severely harmed our relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800098;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Citizens Attacked in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800098;Several of our country's citizens have been attacked in the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$, an incident spurred on by the severe differences between our country's ideology and their's. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has been extremely reluctant to admit any involvement in the affair, and our relations have been hurt as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800100;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Patriots;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800100;We have been contacted by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots, currently living under the dominion of a neighboring country. They suggest that there is an opportunity to stir up sentiment among those living there so that they may rise up and rejoin the mother country. There is, of course, a risk that our efforts could be discovered and bring war down upon us. Should we help them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800101;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Spreading Dissent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800101;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been inciting dissent among minorities in $COUNTRY$. This is an act of aggression that deserves a swift response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800102;We Have Been Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800102;Our efforts to incite $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots in $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been discovered. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is threatening war over this breach of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800147;Sepoy Rebels Force Concessions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800147;The Indian subcontinent has been overwhelmed by the Sepoy rebels. Our garrisons are in retreat, and our colonial governors have already fled for safer ports. We have no choice but to give into their demands, many of which involve removing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence from any of the nations we have subjugated over the years of our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800148;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Driven Out of South Asia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800148;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ presence in South Asia has come to an end, thanks to the spread of the Sepoy Rebellion. With $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governors fleeing the subcontinent in droves, our nation suddenly has a chance to regain lost lands and obtain our freedom ...whether we wish it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800149;Rebels Storm $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800149;After a swarm of violence and looting that engulfed the entire nation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rioters have stormed the capital. The government has been forced to make numerous concessions, in a desperate bid to calm the people. So far it seems to have worked, and has spared many leaders from being executed by angry mobs, but it remains to be seen whether these concessions will only cause more problems in the end than they solved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800150;Pan-Nationalists Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800150;Pan-nationalist rebels demanding a greater $UNION_ADJ$ union have taken over $CAPITAL$, and have begun spreading the idea of $COUNTRY$ becoming part of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ no matter the cost to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800151;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Patriots;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800151;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in a neighboring country, and have gained sufficient control that they have sent word they wish to bring the province back to $COUNTRY$. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800152;Provinces Brought Under Control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800152;With the patriot rebellion now over, our provinces have now been brought under control and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors are once again in command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880130;Reactionary Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880130;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionary party. Aristocrats have allegedly been receiving payments and other illegal benefits for supporting the cause, while the party leader is shown to have made a fortune with sensitive national information. This has been declared beyond the pale even by reactionary supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the reactionary cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880140;Conservative Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880140;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ conservative party. Party leaders were allegedly paid secretly by local land owners to tweak laws in their favor, governmental positions given to favorites, goods stolen from  government warehouses - the list goes on and on. This has been declared beyond the pale even by conservative supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the conservative cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880150;Liberal Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880150;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberal party. Popular candidates have allegedly been involved in smuggling of illicit goods, used questionable tactics to buy votes and speculated on investments with government funds. This has been declared beyond the pale even by liberal supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely damaging the liberal cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880160;Anarcho-Liberal Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880160;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ anarcho-liberal party. Several wealthy businessmen evaded taxes with the help of party members, who in return received kickbacks and a great deal of illegal funding for the party. This has been declared beyond the pale even by anarcho-liberal supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severly damaging the anarcho-liberal cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880170;Socialist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880170;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist party. Illegal union activity, blackmail of important citizens, mistreatment of servants - the facts speak for themselves. This has been declared beyond the pale even by socialist supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severely hurting the socialist cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880180;Communist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880180;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ communist party. While preaching water for the masses, important communist party officals appear to drink wine. Police has secured several party coffers filled with dirty money from illegal activities, stolen art and conterfeit documents. This has been declared beyond the pale even by communist supporters, severely hurting the communist cause in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880190;Fascist Party Rocked by Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880190;Rumors were around for some time, but a newspaper has finally published evidence of a wide-reaching scandal affecting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ fascist party. A militant group associated with the fascists was revealed to have murdered several socialist politicians, tortured priests and attempted to burn the mansion of a wealthy minority leader. This has been declared beyond the pale even by fascist supporters and has caused a huge uproar within $COUNTRY$, severly damaging the fascist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880200;Grave Consequences;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880200;As more and more evidence against the ruling party has come to light, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it has no choice but to resign and call an election. The decision was made after several weeks of heated debate, and it is already well-known that certain members of the government-- those most sorely hit by the scandal-- have been repudiated by the ruling party and will not be seeking re-election. How this will affect the government's chances is so far unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME880210;New Evidence Worsens Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC880210;Investigation of the current party scandal by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ press has brought to light a number of interesting facts. It seems that abuse of power and influence goes well beyond what was initially revealed. Only the surface of this affair has been touched so far, and God only knows what might turn up within the next few weeks. No-one in $COUNTRY$ appears to be discussing anything else at the moment, and already there are calls in the press for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to step down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999000;National Debate: Trade Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999000;Let the debate take its own course, and let the chips fall where they may!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999000;Freedom of trade shall not perish from this Earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999001;National Debate: Economic Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999001;The debate had been going on for several hours, when a candidate stepped forward and presented arguments for their cause which silenced all opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999001;Decisive arguments for Laissez Faire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999001;Decisive arguments for Interventionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999001;Decisive arguments for State Capitalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999001;Decisive arguments for Planned Economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999002;National Debate: Religious Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country's view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999002;There are no Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999002;Religion is not a political issue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999002;Let the people have their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999002;There is one faith and one faith only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999003;National Debate: Citizenship Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999003;Give them residency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999003;We need to limit their citizenship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999003;Let them have full citizenship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999004;National Debate: War Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999004;Patriots and pacifists are fighting in the townhouse, using words to hurt and kill their enemies. A long since dead and buried dispute between $COUNTRY$ and its neighbor has once again shown its ugly head. Patriots wish to invade the country while pacifists believe that there are other ways to resolve the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999004;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999004;Violence can be used, but in this situation it would be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999004;War between countries is never good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999004;This can be solved without violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999010;The Political Campaign Of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999010;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political parties have begun a nationwide election campaign. So far, the effects have been quite limited, but in the end, one party will gain the upper hand. Advisors state that we could try to influence the outcome ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999010;Support the Conservative parties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999010;Support the Reactionary parties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999010;Support the Liberal parties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999010;Let the campaigns take their course and do not intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTE999011;Support the Anarcho-Liberal parties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTF999012;Support the Socialist parties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTG999014;Support the Communist parties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTH999015;Support the Fascist parties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999020;Calm Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention,  and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999020;There shall be peace and quite in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999021;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occured in several large factories, with incidents of streetfighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999021;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999022;Riots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999022;The tensions from the current election campaign have escalated, with disorder spreading fast in $CAPITAL$ and spreading elsewhere. Advisors are recommending that the military be brought into the capital to restore order, though doing so will only contain the violence at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999022;Send in the army. Order must be restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999022;Let the riots play their course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999030;Surge Of Socialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999030;It looks like the socialists have a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999030;We will have an eye on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999031;Surge Of Communism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999031;It looks like the communists have a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$, their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME999033;Surge Of Liberalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999033;It looks like the liberals have a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999034;The Anarcho-Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999034;It looks like the anarcho liberals, a group of radicals who have taken the liberal ideals to their extreme, have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999035;The Social Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999035;A new breed of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberals has become very active in the current election-- educated liberals who believe equally in both social and political reform. They have been actively campaigning for people to support both, and have been attracting a lot of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999036;Reactionary Surge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999036;There are a large number of people, particularly among the ruling elite of $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills. They advocate controls on immigration and a repeal of voting rights. They also appear to have charismatic speakers, for they seem to be gathering a lot of attention in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999037;Surge of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999037;It looks like the conservatives have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999040;National Debate: Voting Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999040;'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n\nThe industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999040;They are right - support their reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999040;Voting rights for the middle class? Nay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999040;A reform is long past due - issue a new voting right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999041;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999041;'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' \n\nWhile being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights, and the subject has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999041;Sounds like a good idea, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999041;Stop these ungrateful wretches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999041;We shall do this right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999042;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999042;'Why is everyone trying to keep us out of politics? Because we are uneducated? They call us minors, but that is a lie! Our sweet and toil has brought the nation forward! We have waited long enough - now we demand our just due!' \n\nThe subject of voting rights for the poor has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999042;Better late then never.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999042;Better never than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999042;Better now than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC999043;'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed' \n - Thomas Jefferson;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999043;A rightful initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999043;Enough is enough! Stop that nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999043;Equal votes for equal chances - NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999044;Right In The Face;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999044;'They have beaten me, again and again. Why? Because I am a proud citizen who will speak the truth! I don't believe that the ruling party will save us. And my weapon is logic, but theirs is the stick.'\n\nThe issue of political party harassment has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999044;This has to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999044;There is no need to change the system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999045;Election Fraud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD! That's what it is, I tell you!'\n\nThe issue of voter district gerrymandering has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999045;You are right, we have to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999045;Want me to play the world's smallest violin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999046;Request For Privacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999046;'Why does everyone stare at me when I make my vote? Do they really need to know? It is not like I am committing a crime or something, I simply want to vote in peace. Without having half of the polling station looking at me, that is.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999046;I guess some privacy would be in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999046;What's next? Blindfolds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999049;National Debate: Unemployment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999049;The liberals are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999049;The socialists are right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999049;Do not get involved in the debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999050;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999050;Communism is our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999050;Fascism is our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999050;Social reform can be achieved without radicalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999049;Do not get involved in the debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999055;The Child Labor Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999056;The Rights of Minorities;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999057;The Immigration Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999060;War Dominates the Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999061;Talk of War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbours, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999065;The Slavery Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010011;The Great Irish Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010012;Irish Famine Spreads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010012;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt-- poor Irish peasants are walking the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, begging for government aid which never arrives, and many are obviously considering making their way to the New World out of desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010013;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt-- poor Irish peasants are walking the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, barely subsisting on the limited cornmeal handouts offered by the government, and many are obviously considering making their way to the New World out of desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010014;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt--in $PROVINCENAME$, the Irish are gathering in large crowds to receive aid sent by the British government. While they are grateful, times are still incredibly difficult and it's clear many are considering leaving Ireland to take their chances in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010015;The Young Irelander Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010016;Ireland's Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010016;Not content to wait until the dust of the war has settled, nationalists in Ireland have taken to the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ to call for the end of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. With our forces engaged elsewhere, their calls have quickly swept across all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010020;The Irish Republican Brotherhood;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010020;The tone among the people in our Irish territories has changed. Many Irish nationalist who emigrated to the United States founded a militant organization called the Fenian Brotherhood there, a group dedicated to freeing Ireland from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control... and now they have formed a sister organization back home, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Already they are stirring up trouble, and it seems certain they will continue until some manner of home rule is attained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010021;Fenians in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010021;We've received reports that the Irish Republican Brotherhood has been active in $PROVINCENAME$, spreading propaganda and generally stirring up agitation against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. The constabulary in $STATENAME$ has been actively hunting these nationalists down, but considering many within the constabulary are Irish themselves the process has not been simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010022;Fenian Revolt in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010022;The Irish Republican Brotherhood has stirred up local resentment in $PROVINCENAME$, resulting in several riots and a renewed campaign against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule in Ireland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010023;The Easter Rising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010023;In an event organized by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a group of Irish nationalists seized key locations in the city of $PROVINCENAME$ on Easter Monday, kicking off the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010024;The Sinn Féin Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence. Considering their popularity, refusing would all but certainly trigger a war... but many agree that this is not the way to a peaceful resolution, and that $COUNTRY$ should never submit to such demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010025;The Anglo-Irish Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010025;With Ireland once again under our control, talks have begun in earnest to deal with the Irish situation once and for all... now on our terms, rather than on theirs. The suggestion is that Ireland remain an autonomous Dominion under our control, with any regions that wish to opt out of the new state and remain part of $COUNTRY$ able to do so. Others suggest this is unworkable, and we should either simply release them and keep them as allies or annex them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010030;Charles Stewart Parnell;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he's a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent-- able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It's very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010031;The $STATENAME$ Volunteers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state-- one dominated by Irish catholics in Dublin. They have begun actively campaigning to ensure this doesn't happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010032;Irish Home Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who-- in the not-too-distant past-- might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable./n/nNow we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way," this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;
EVTNAME1010033;Kitty O'Shea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010033;The revelation that Charles Stewart Parnell has been involved with a married woman, one Catherine O'Shea, and indeed is responsible for her subsequent divorce, was the scandal that ended his political career and prevented him from pushing the Home Rule agenda. Without him, it appears unlikely that the Irish Republican movement will gain the political clout it requires to attempt another passing of the Home Rule Bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11380019;Constitutional Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11380019;In a surprise election win, the fascists have taken power in the government. Technically they are allowed to do so, and their party has not been banned. There are concerns, however, that their ultimate goal is to take over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and that this election win is just the first step in doing so. Some are even suggesting the possibility of voter fraud. Regardless, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken... and the monarchy must decide whether to intervene and refuse the fascists their mandate as many expect. Failure to intervene means admitting that they have no power and thus relinquishing all control over the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC11380022;In a surprise election win, the communists have taken power in the government-- despite the fact that their party opposes the monarchy and has been banned. Regardless, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken, and thus a political showdown has resulted: the communists cannot be permitted to win, but even if they're refused the next election might simply have the same crisis occur all over again. Perhaps the time has come to reconsider electoral reforms and put the power back where it belongs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME152009872;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC152009872;There is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership-- elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective. And it seems many of the men under their command agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By operating deep inside Free American territory, and by destroying much of the north's civilian infrastructure, Sherman is often said to have broken the North's will to fight. Apply his methods, and it might be the final nail in the FSA's coffin.;Durant la campagne qu'il mena en Géorgie de novembre à décembre 1864, le Major-général William Tecumseh Sherman appliqua une doctrine de guerre totale, que l'on pourrait plutôt qualifier de campagne de terreur ayant pour cible la population civile du Sud.

Appliquons sa méthode, et cela pourrait être le dernier clou du cercueil des Confédérés.;Während des Feldzuges durch Georgia im November und Dezember 1864 wandte Generalmajor William Tecumseh Sherman die Doktrinen des Totalen Krieges mit nur als Terrorkampagne zu bezeichnenden Aktionen gegen die Zivilbevölkerung des Südens an. Durch Operationen tief in konföderiertem Gebiet und durch Zerstörung eines Großteils der Infrastruktur von Georgia brach Sherman vielen Meinungen nach den Kampfeswillen des Südens. Wenden Sie seine Methoden an - vielleicht werden sie der letzte Nagel im Sarg der Konföderation sein.;;Durante la campaña llevada a cabo en Georgia entre noviembre y diciembre de 1864, el general William Tecumseh Sherman aplicó las doctrinas de la guerra total en lo que podría describirse perfectamente como una campaña de terror dirigida contra las poblaciones civiles del sur. Se cree que al operar en el interior de territorio confederado y destruir gran parte de la infraestructura civil del enemigo, Sherman logró quebrantar la voluntad de combatir del sur.

annex_fiji_desc;With Australian settlers having puchased land on the island of Fiji, they have slowly become insinuated within the court of King Cakobau.

invest_in_irish_title;Invest in the Irish;;;;;;;;;;;;;
invest_in_irish_desc;In order to bring the Irish up to par as an integral part of the British Empire, a great deal of investment will be needed-- to not only upgrade the decaying institutions which have been governing the island for centuries, but to also end the system of absentee landowners which so pervades the island's bureaucracy and which makes it a model of inefficiency.

purchase_spanish_pacific_desc;With the Spanish having lost their colonial facilities in Manila, their Pacific holdings are difficult to administrate and incredibly expensive for them.

demand_retreat_from_india_desc;The majority of India has been wrested from British control. A choice is upon us: either demand their retreat from the sub-continent, freeing all their vassals and annexed lands, or continue our war and hope to achieve our current goals. A British retreat may result in chaos, and we certainly would not attain the war goals we have in play, but it would at least take the British out of the equation for the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

meiji_constitution_desc;After an exhaustive study of western democratic methods, japanese scholars have settled on a method of government where the Emperor will preside over an Imperial Diet, elected by the people and yet preserving both Imperial power as well as our traditions.

begin_line_of_advantage_title;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
begin_line_of_advantage_desc;The concept of riekisen, or the 'line of advantage', means that we must extend Japanese influence beyond our national borders in order to ensure our security.

claim_korea_title;Claim Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_korea_desc;With Korea under foreign rule, our nation feels threatened. The 'line of advantage' means that protecting our borders means extending our influence beyond them, and thus we must move to claim the Korean peninsula and wrest it from those who hold it in their grasp-- in the name of Korean freedom, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
order_to_expel_barbarians_title;Order to Expel Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
order_to_expel_barbarians_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the role of the Emperor has been confined to that of figurehead. We lead Japan, yet we do not. Recently, the leadership of the Shogun has come into question. His increasing inability to deal with foreigners in a way that shows any manner of leadership compels the Emperor to act-- with or without the Shogun's permission. We shall send out a call to the people in our own name, demanding they rise up and throw out the foreigners that the Shogun will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peace_with_the_emperor_title;Peace With the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peace_with_the_emperor_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the Emperor has remained a figurehead. Even so, he is a leader of the Japanese people and, at times, has expressed dissatisfaction with our own position as ruler of Japan. This has caused conflict, and should we reach a point where our positions are not so different-- and, indeed, the Emperor is satisfied with our ability to rule, perhaps we can bring this conflict to an end once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

unite_the_daimyos_desc;With the daimyos under our complete dominance, we will be in a position to fully bring them under the government's control.

austrian_form_south_german_confederation2_desc;While Germany was not united until the proclamation of the German Empire, following the Franco-Prussian war, rising nationalism in the 19th century had meant that unification had been on the cards long before that, with the Frankfurt assembly of 1848 being an important forerunner. By achieving a dominant position among the South German states, we can form the South German Confederation.;Il fallut attendre la proclamation de l'Empire allemand qui suivit la guerre franco-allemande pour assister à l'unification de l'Allemagne. Pourtant, avec la montée du nationalisme au XIXe siècle, l'unification aurait été possible bien avant cela, comme en témoigne l'assemblée de Francfort de 1848. En nous imposant dans les États du sud, nous formerons les États du sud de l'Allemagne.;Obwohl Deutschland bis zur Proklamation des Deutschen Kaiserreichs nach dem deutsch-französischen Krieg nicht geeint war, bedeutete der steigende Nationalismus des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, dass eine Vereinigung schon seit langer Zeit geplant war. Ein wichtiges vorbereitendes Ereignis war die Frankfurter Nationalversammlung von 1848. Wenn wir uns eine dominierende Position unter den norddeutschen Staaten erarbeiten, können wir den Süddeutschen Bund gründen.;;Aunque Alemania no estuvo unida hasta la proclamación del Imperio Alemán, tras la guerra franco-prusiana, el nacionalismo emergente del siglo XIX puso de relieve que la unificación era inevitable. La asamblea de Frankfurt de 1848 supuso un importante precedente.

austrian_form_south_german_confederation_title;Create the South German Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
austrian_form_south_german_confederation_desc;With our dominant position over the south German states, we can create the South German Confederation -- a union that would be under our full control, and a more useful ally than the nations separately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mediate_belgian_independence_title;Mediate Belgian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mediate_belgian_independence_desc;While Belgium's de facto independence from The Netherlands had been established by force of arms during the Belgian revolution of 1831, it has not been confirmed de jure by The Netherlands and technically a state of war still exists between the two nations. The idea has arisen that the British Empire should step in and mediate a settlement, demanding the Dutch give up their claims in return for guarantees of Belgian independence and control over Luxembourg. With the powers of Europe at the table, it seems unlikely the Dutch would refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

convention_of_peking_title;The Peking Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
convention_of_peking_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Aigun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China. There are many within the government, however, who believe it would be in our best interest to access a southern port upon the Sea of Japan -- namely the Chinese city of HaIshenwai. Considering the Chinese only barely control their northeastern provinces, it seems within our right to negotiate for their control… and with their state of turmoil now if the best time to approach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peking_convention_TPG_title;The Peking Convention;La convention de Pékin.;Die Pekinger Konvention;;La convención de Pekín;;;;;;;;;
peking_convention_TPG_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China.  In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;Depuis le traité de Nerchinsk (1689), l’Empire russe a reconnu le fleuve Argun et les monts Stanovoy comme frontière naturelle entre la Russie et la Chine.  Au cours du XIXe siècle, les Russes franchirent cette frontière pour s’emparer des vastes territoires entre les monts Stanovoy et le fleuve Amour. Les Puissances occidentales mirent plus tard un terme à la seconde guerre de l’opium en brûlant les palais d’été de l’empereur et en s’emparant de Pékin. Un général russe avisé du nom de Nicolaï Ignatiev parvint à convaincre les chinois que seul le soutien de la Russie permettrait l'évacuation de Pékin par les alliés. Le prix de ce soutien fut la convention de Pékin, qui entérinait les conquêtes de Muravyov et cédait à la Russie les territoires entre le fleuve Ussuri et la côte pacifique. Ainsi, la Russie gagna-t-elle 560 000 kilomètres carrés sans tirer un coup de fusil.;Seit dem Vertrag von Nertschinsk (1689) hatte das russische Reich den Fluss Argun und das Stanowoigebirge als natürliche Grenze zwischen Russland und China betrachtet. Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts wollten die Russen diese Grenze erweitern, um das weiträumige Gebiet zwischen dem Stanowoigebirge und dem Fluss Amur zu annektieren. Später beendeten die westlichen Alliierten den zweiten Opiumkrieg durch Niederbrennen der Sommerpaläste des chinesischen Kaisers und marschierten in Peking ein. Der gerissene Generalmajor Nikolai Ignatjew konnte die Chinesen überzeugen, dass sie die Westmächte nur mit russischer Unterstützung zum Abzug bewegen können würden. Der Preis für diese Unterstützung war die Pekinger Konvention, die Murawjows Forderungen bestätigte und Russland zusätzlich noch das Territorium zwischen dem Fluss Ussuri und dem Pazifik zusprach. Russland hatte sich also einen Gebietsgewinn von 350000 Quadratmeilen verschafft, ohne einen einzigen Schuss dafür abzufeuern.;;Desde el tratado de Nerchinsk (1689), el imperio ruso siempre había reconocido el río Argun y la cordillera de Stanovoy como fronteras naturales entre Rusia y China.  A mediados del siglo XIX, los rusos se expandirían más allá de esta frontera para apoderarse de los vastos territorios situados entre las montañas Stanovoy y el río Amur. Más adelante, los países occidentales pondrían fin a la Segunda Guerra del Opio incendiando los palacios estivales del emperador de China y ocupando Pekín. Un astuto general llamado Nikolay Ignatiev logró convencer a los chinos de que solo el apoyo de Rusia obligaría a los aliados a evacuar la capital. El precio de este apoyo fue la convención de Pekín, donde se confirmaron las ganancias obtenidas por Muravyov y, además, China cedió a Rusia nuevos territorios entre el río Ussuri y el Pacífico. De este modo, Rusia adquirió unas 350.000 millas cuadradas de territorio sin tener que disparar un solo tiro.;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC20111;A recent riot in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought a great deal of attention to $STATENAME$-- the kind that would normally prompt the great powers to consider intervention.

EVTNAME32521;Treaty of Shimoda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32521;Vice-Admiral Yevfimy Putiatin has sailed from Russia to $COUNTRY$ on a mission to establish formal relations and to define the borders between our respective territories. After months of negotiation, we have agreed to open three ports to Russian merchants and to guarantee Russian ships access through $COUNTRY_ADJ$ waters and straits. Both sides have agreed that our borders in the Kuril Islands lay just north of Etorofu, and propose to share sovereignty over Sakhalin Island. The finished treaty was signed on February 7th, $YEAR$ in Shimoda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32521;May our empires prosper together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32522;Trouble in Sakhalin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32522;Conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian and Japanese claims, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. There are several solutions we could propose: first, we could officially divide the island between us and Japan, essentially legalising the status quo. This would be generous of us, and it would improve our relations with Japan. Second, we could push for full control of Sakhalin, offering in return to concede the northern Kuril Islands and make resettlement payments to those displaced. This would represent a modest profit, but Japan might not agree to it. Finally, we could demand full control of Sakhalin and offer nothing in return. This would hurt our reputation, and it would badly offend the Japanese, who would probably refuse. How should our diplomats proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32523;It seems that conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. The Russian recently approached us, all smiles and willingness to co-operate. They have offered to make the current status quo official: Sakhalin will have a border drawn dividing it in two. Considering the fact they could have forced the issue, it seems they want us to be friends rather than enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32524;It seems that conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have proposed an exchange of border territories: we would give them complete control of Sakhalin, and in return they would cede the northern Kuril Islands all the way to Kamchatka. Russia has also offered to make resettlement payments to help Japanese to relocate from Sakhalin. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.If we accept, we will lose a modest territory but improve relations with Russia. On the other hand, if we insist on the status quo, we will keep our present territory but risk escalating the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32525;It seems conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have outrageously demanded that we give them full control of Sakhalin, in exchange for nothing! Their negotiators hint darkly at Russian ships shelling Japanese ports if we should refuse. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin. If we give in, we will lose a promising colony and look weak to other nations. But, if we insist on the status quo, the conflict is likely to escalate into open war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32526;Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32526;The Japanese have refused our proposal, and they now insist that they will settle for nothing less than the present division of Sakhalin. We can back down and accept the status quo, or we can use force to get our way. If we accept the status quo after reaching for more, we will look weak to the other Powers, though relations with Japan will be preserved. But, our only other option now is to declare aggressive war for the islands, which will hurt our reputation abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32527;Treaty of Saint Petersburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32527;The treaty has been signed! Our borders in Sakhalin and the Kurils are now settled, and ships from both empires have been guaranteed access through the Strait of Tartary and the Sea of Okhotsk. This should ease tensions in the region considerably and ensure close diplomatic ties between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC33030;The Society for German Colonization has been attempting to colonize the Zanzibar coast for several years now, having formed the German East Africa company and signed several treaties with Swahili tribes. It now seems they are facing difficulty with rebellions and have asked us to step in.

This may be an interesting opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33031;German Warships!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33031;For the last several years, Swahili tribes on the coast have been making treaties with Europeans, allowing them to create small settlements.

If we do this, they say, we shall be safe from further molestation-- and they claim we do not truly control the coast anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97680;Japan has quarreled with Russia before over the rule of Sakhalin Island. Now, our influence in China and Korea has led to renewed friction between our nations.

EVTDESC99000;'Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreign!'/n/nMany Chinese are growing enraged at the continuing encroachment of westerners into the Empire. They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society -- known to foreigners as 'Boxers' -- has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qing Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qing government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC99010;The Boxers have reached the capital of $COUNTRY$, streaming into $CAPITAL$ to attack foreigners -- and, far more noteworthy, they have laid siege to the Legation Quarter. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries and merchants reside within. If we do not step in to protect them, it will be seen as a declaration of support for the Boxers and an act of war against the great powers. If we do, the Boxers will see it as a betrayal of their cause and perhaps even rise up in rebellion against us. They have forced our hand now, however, and we have no choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99011;Boxers Attack $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99011;The Boxer situation in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached a head: the Chinese nationalists have entered Peking, laying siege to the Legation Quarter and putting the lives of dozes of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants and dignitaries at risk.
