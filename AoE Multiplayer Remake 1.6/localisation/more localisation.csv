macau_transfer_desc;In several ports,like Macau, local garrisons and saliors were able to preserve order during the colonial upheaval that followed the creation of the Iberian state. While most ports have been transfered to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control, Macau has yet been properly transfered to the proper authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

outside_italia_irredenta_desc;Italy's new claims do not conflict with our territorial interests. As a show of good faith, let us hand over any province of ours that lies within their claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
austrian_outside_italy_title;Organize Italy Under Strict Austrian Supervision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
austrian_outside_italy_desc;As Metternich said, "Italy is a geographical expression." That being said, its an expression of strategic importance to $COUNTRY$. With the peninsula under our thumb, it might be time to reorganize the duchies and republics of Italy into more manageable kingdoms. We will also be able to cement our authority over Venice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72758;The Austrians have recently been drawing lines in Italy, and have with no justificaiton or legal claim included Corsica in the domain of Sardinia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72757;It would seem that our supervision was not as strict as planned. During the redrawning of Italian borders, the finialized map of the new Italian vassals included the island of Corisca within the territorial bounders of Sardinia. While this detail went unnoticed by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials, it has grabbed the attention of the French. Infurated, France has demanded an immediate explanation followed by an apology from $COUNTRY$ over the actions of their vassal. Some believe that $COUNTRY$ should apologize and scold Sardinia. The island's stupidity may very well lead to war. Others believe Vienna should stand by its vassals no matter the circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

FRA_SRD_claim_rebuke_desc;After defeating the Sardinians in the latest war, France may finially correct the Sardinian Border Blunder caused by the Austrian imbeciles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72754;Although $COUNTRY$ has tried to control the Italian peninsula through the creation of Lombardy, Sicily, and the Papal rump state, the fires of Italian nationalism continue to burn. Many in Vienna are of the opinion that an unified Italy is impossbile to avoid, and it is best that the Italian state be created peacefully through $COUNTRY_ADJ$ guidance rather through a bloody revolution. Others argued that a unified Italy will quickly grow out of our control. Either way a decision must be reached on what to do with Italy. The question then arises who shall rule the Italy. Should it be Lombardy in the north? Perphaps the legacy of Austrian rule in Milan will result in a loyal and capable subject? On the other hand, the rulers of Sicily were once of Hapsburg blood, and it could be wise to keep things in the family. There are some who say the crown should to neither the Lombards nor the Sicilians, but rather the Holy Father himself in Rome. And of course there are those boring old sods who want to keep the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS_italy_crown_title;The Question of the Italian Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS_italy_crown_desc;The time has come for $COUNTRY$ to face the growing tide of nationalism that has swept through the Italian peninsula. The crisis is coming to a head and a decision must be made on the future of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC72751;At the expense of most of their colonial possessions, the Iberian Peninsula is under firm $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. While the most obvious choice is to have Iberia ruled by the Spanish majority and governed in the centrally located city of Madrid, there are arguments to be made in favor of the peninsula‚Äôs other nationalities. In contrast to Spanish who were facing revolts both Carlist and colonialist alike, Portugal has experienced relative stability. Perhaps they would be better fit to administer Iberia? On the other side of the peninsula are the Catalans.  The best way to quell their nationalistic tendencies might to give them a nation look after. There are some who argue that to exert control, the ruling elite must be kept to small minority and have therefore recommended the Basque.  One more thing to note, is a letter has recently been received petitioning for the Galicians although this might be some sort of practical joke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC72750;The Scandinavian people of the north are so culturally similar, it only makes sense that they should be organized into one state. A state, of course, looked after by $COUNTRY$. The question arises where the new capital of this union should be, and in in what language the capital should expect to receive reports. As of right now, the current consensus is place administrative duties in the hands of the Danes as they were the original rulers of the Kalmar Union of old. However, Copenhagen is surrounded by the sea and could therefore be vulnerable to nearby naval powers. Stockholm a city would make a fine capital, and the Swedes once had dominion over the Baltics. Perhaps their time should come again, but with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ supervision. The Norwegians have a history of being subservient, first under the Danes then more recently under the Swedes. Perhaps there is no one better to rule a puppet state than former vassal? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR_valencia_title;Move Capital to Valencia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR_valencia_desc;Although Barcelona is not under our control, we have still be given mandate over Iberia. We should move our capital south to Valencia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC56278;With the defeat an inevitability, the Confederate government has fled to the island of Cuba. Some are arguing the Union should make pursuit and invade the island. Others saying it is necessary to take advantage of the peace to end the bloodshed and rebuild the States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

csa_flee_cub_desc;The war is lost! The gentlemen of the Southern States must flee to Cuba so that we might live to fight another day. Hopefully the Union will stop their aggression at the sea although we cannot be certain they will not pursue us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC56277;Now that Cuba is under Union authority once more, we must decide what to do with the rebellious rebel island. Some argue the island should be handed over the Afro-Cubano population and granted home rule. Others say military rule will continue to be necessary to keep the peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ITA_AUS_VEN_title;Nullify the Treaty of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ITA_AUS_VEN_desc;In exchange for a united Italy, Austria forced Italian nationalist to sign the Treaty of Venice which guaranteed Austrian sovereignty over Venice and other Italian lands. Italy agreed not to push any claims against the Austrian, but recent shifts in relations has made Vienna no friend of Rome. Italy can no longer be the lap dog of the Germans and as such the Treaty of Venice must be considered null and void so that Italian unification can truly be completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9318716;The Italian ambassador has recently informed us of his government's decision to nullify the Treaty of Venice which legitimized Austrian rule over Venice and other Italian speaking lands. This marks an end to Austro-Italian friendship. War is most likely on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_elass_lorraine_title;Treaty of Elsaﬂ-Lorraine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
treaty_of_elass_lorraine_desc;While $COUNTRY$ is prepared to battle with France over Elsaﬂ-Lothringen until the end of time, constant war is neither necessary nor beneficial. With a recent cooling in relations between France and Germany, the doves in $CAPITAL$ have proposed border negotiations with France and even suggests seceding Metz. A border treaty would not be popular with the Prussian elements of society, but it might be necessary to preserve peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC6542984;For quite some time, there has been a cooling of relations between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$, and in a surprising turn of events, the Germans have requested to negotiate over the hotly contested land of Alsace-Lorraine. In return for recognizing German rule over the provinces of Colmar and Strasbourg, they are willing to return Metz back to French control. Some say this treaty will finally bring peace to the west, others say it would be a stab in the back of the people of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7184127;France has refused to negotiate and will not compromise for the sake of peace. The recent diplomatic progress has been squandered, and war is once again the status quo. Anger has swept across the land as the German people realize French militarism cannot be bargained with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7686768;While the notion of Germany choosing diplomacy over Prussian militarism was surprising, the willingness of France to compromise in face of revanchism was even more shocking. The lands of Alsace-Lorraine have been partitioned between the two states in a bid for peace. Celebration has erupted across the streets of Paris and $CAPITAL$ to mark this new period of peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2317187;It would seem peace was not meant to last between the people of Germany and France. After coup by radicals in the government, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared the treaty of Elsaﬂ-Lorraine null and void. The border between France and Germany is quickly being remilitarized once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
